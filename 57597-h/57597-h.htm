<h2 id="A_WORD_TO_THE_DEDICATEE">A WORD TO THE DEDICATEE</h2>

<p>[<i>Note: The following is the substance of a little “Welcome”
which the author was requested to write to American soldiers
and sailors visiting England for the first time during
the fateful days of 1918. It was distributed upon the transports
and in various American centres in England. Its
purpose is to set forth some of our national peculiarities—and
incidentally the author’s Confession of Faith. It has
no bearing upon the rest of the story, and may be skipped
by the reader without compunction.</i>]</p>

<h3>I. A Word of Explanation</h3>

<p>I write this welcome to you American soldiers and
sailors because I know America personally and therefore
I know what the word “welcome” means. And I see right
away from the start that it is going to be a difficult
proposition for us over here to compete with America
in that particular industry. However, we mean to try,
and we hope to succeed. Anyway, we shall not fail from
lack of good-will.</p>

<p>Having bid you welcome to our shores, I am next
going to ask you to remember just one thing.</p>

<p>We are very, very short-handed at present. During
the past four years the people of the British Isles have
contributed to our common cause more than six million
soldiers and sailors. On a basis of population, the purely
British contribution to the forces of the British Empire
should have been seventy-six per cent. The actual contribution
has been eighty-four per cent; and when we
come to casualties, not eighty-four but eighty-six per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
cent of the total have been borne by those two little
islands, Great Britain and Ireland, which form the
cradle of our race. You can, therefore, imagine the strain
upon our man-power. Every man up to the age of fifty
is now liable to be drafted. The rest of our male population—roughly
five millions—are engaged night and
day in such occupations as shipbuilding, coal-mining,
munition-making, and making two blades of corn grow
where one grew before. They are assisted in every
department, even in the war zone, by hundreds and
thousands of devoted women.</p>

<p>So we ask you to remember that the England which
you see is not England as she was, and as she hopes to
be again. You see England in overalls; all her pretty
clothes are put away for the duration. Some day we
hope once again to travel in trains where there is room
to sit down; in motor omnibuses and trolley cars for
which you have not to wait in line. We hope again to
see our streets brightly lit, our houses freshly painted,
flower boxes glowing in every window, and fountains
playing in Trafalgar Square. We hope to see the city
once again crowded with traffic as thick as that on Fifth
Avenue at Forty-second Street, and the uncanny silence
of our present-day streets banished by the cheerful turmoil
of automobiles and taxis. And above all we hope to
see the air-raid shelters gone, and the hundreds of crippled
men in hospital blue no longer visible in our streets,
and the long lines of motor ambulances, which assemble
every evening outside the stations to meet the hospital
trains, swept away forever.</p>

<p>That is the old London—London as we would have
you see it—London as we hope you will see it when
you come back to us as holiday visitors. Meanwhile, we
know you will make allowances for us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span></p>

<p>Also, you may not find us very hilarious. In some ways
we are strangely cheerful. For instance, you will see little
mourning worn in public. That is because, if black were
worn by all those who were entitled to wear it, you would
see little else. Again, you will find our theatres packed
night after night by a noisy, cheerful throng. But these
are not idle people, nor are they the same people all the
time. They are almost entirely hard-worked folks enjoying
a few days’ vacation. The majority of them are soldiers
on leave from the Front. Few of them will be here
next week; some of them will never see a play again.
The play goes on and helps the audience to forget for a
while, but it is a different audience every time.</p>

<p>And you will hear little talk about the War. We
prefer to talk of almost anything else. Probably you
will understand why. There is hardly a house in this
country which has not by this time made a personal
contribution to our cause. In each of these houses
one of two trials is being endured—bereavement, the
lesser evil, or suspense, the greater. We cannot, therefore,
talk lightly of the War, and being determined not
to talk anxiously about it, we compromise—we do not
talk about it at all.</p>

<p>We want you to know this. To know is to understand.</p>

<h3>II. First Impressions</h3>

<p>Meanwhile, let us ask for your impressions of our
country. It is only fair that we should be allowed to do
this, for you know what happens to visitors in the
United States when the reporters get their hooks into
them.</p>

<p>So far as I have been able to gather, your impressions
amount to something like this:</p>

<p>There is no ice-water, no ice-cream, no soda-fountains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
no pie. It is hard to get the old familiar eats in our
restaurants.</p>

<p>Our cities are planned in such a way that it is impossible
to get to any place without a map and compass.</p>

<p>Our traffic all keeps to the wrong side of the street.</p>

<p>Our public buildings are too low.</p>

<p>There are hardly any street-car lines in London.</p>

<p>Our railroad cars are like boxes, and our locomotives
are the smallest things on earth.</p>

<p>Our weather is composed of samples.</p>

<p>Our coinage system is a practical joke.</p>

<p>Nobody, whether in street, train or tube, ever enters
in conversation with you. If by any chance they do, they
grouch all the time about the Government and the
general management of the country.</p>

<p>Let us take the eats and drinks first. There is no ice-water.
I admit it. I am sorry, but there it is. There never
was much, but now that ammonia is mostly commandeered
for munition work, there is less than ever. As a
nation we do not miss it. In this country our difficulty
is not to get cool, but to keep warm. Besides, it is possible
that our moist climate, and the absence of steam-heat
in our houses, saves us from that parched feeling
which I have so often experienced in the United States.
Anyway, that familiar figure of American domestic life,
the iceman, is unknown to us. We drink our water at
ordinary temperature—what you would call tepid—and
we keep our meat in a stone cellar instead of the
ice chest. As for ice-cream and soda-fountains, we have
never given ourselves over to them very much. As a
nation, we are hot-food eaters—that is, when we can
get anything to eat! We are living on strict war rations
here, just as you are beginning to do in the States. So
you must forgive our apparent want of hospitality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span></p>

<h3>III. The Land We live in</h3>

<p>Next, our cities. After your own straight, wide,
methodically-numbered streets and avenues, London,
Liverpool, Glasgow, and the rest must seem like a
Chinese puzzle. I can only say in excuse that they have
been there a very long time, and the people who started
in to build them did not foresee that they would ever
extend more than a few blocks. If Julius Cæsar had
known that London was ultimately going to cover an
area of seven hundred square miles, and house a population
of seven and a half millions, I dare say he would
have made a more methodical beginning. But Julius
Cæsar never visited America, and the science of town-planning
was unknown to him.</p>

<p>The narrow, winding streets of London are not suited
to trolley-car lines. This fact has given us the unique
London motor ’bus, driven with incredible skill, and
gay with advertisements. There are not so many of
these ’buses to-day as there might be, and such as
there are are desperately full. But—<i lang="fr">c’est la guerre!</i>
Hundreds of our motor ’buses are over in France
now. You will meet them when you get there, doing
their bit—hurrying reënforcements to some hard-pressed
point, or running from the back areas to the
railhead, conveying happy, muddy Tommies home on
leave.</p>

<p>And while we are discussing London, let me recommend
you to make a point of getting acquainted with
the London policeman. He is a truly great man. Watch
him directing the traffic down in the City, or where
Wellington Street, on its way to Waterloo Bridge,
crosses the Strand. He has no semaphore, no whistle;
but simply extends an arm, or turns his back, and the
traffic swings to right or left, or stops altogether. Foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
cities, even New York, are not ashamed to send
their police to London to pick up hints on traffic control
from the London “Bobby.” Watch him handle an unruly
crowd. He is unarmed, and though he carries a club,
you seldom see it. If you get lost, ask him to direct you,
for he carries a map of London inside his head. He is
everybody’s friend. By the way, if he wears a helmet
he is one of the regular force. A flat cap is a sign of a
“Special”—that is, a business man who is giving his
spare time, by day or night, to take the place of those
policemen who have joined the Colours. But, “Regular”
or “Special,” he is there to help you.</p>

<p>There are no skyscrapers in England. The fact is,
London is no place for skyscrapers. It was New York
which set the fashion. That was because Manhattan
Island, with the Hudson on one side and the East River
on the other, is physically incapable of expansion, and
so New York, being unable to spread out, shot upwards.
Moreover, New York is built on solid rock—you ask
the Subway contractors about that!—while the original
London was built on a marsh, and the marsh is
there still. So it will not support structures like the
Woolworth Building.</p>

<p>Most of our national highways start from London.
There is one, a Roman road, called Watling Street,
which starts from the Marble Arch and runs almost as
straight as a rod from London to Chester, nearly two
hundred miles; and it never changes its name after the
first few miles, which are called the Edgware Road.
Another, the Great North Road, runs from London to
Edinburgh, and is four hundred miles long. One hundred
years ago the mail coaches thundered along that road
night and day, and highwaymen had their own particular
pitches where no other highwaymen dreamed of butting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
in. Five years ago that road was a running river
of touring automobiles. Now, strings of grey military
motor lorries rumble up and down its entire length.
Perhaps you will ride on some of them.</p>

<p>London, easy-going London, has her short cuts, too.
That is where she differs from the methodical, rectangular,
convenient cities of the United States. She is full of
cunning by-ways, and every street has a character of
its own. The Strand was called “The Strand” a thousand
years ago, because it <em>was</em> a strand—a strip of beach
which ran alongside the Thames at the foot of a cliff
(which has long since been smoothed and sloped out of
existence) and was submerged each high tide. The English
fought a great battle with Danish pirates near by,
and to-day the dead Danes sleep their last sleep in St.
Clement Danes’ Church, right in the middle of the
Strand.</p>

<p>Charing Cross, again, is the last of a great chain of
such Crosses, stretching from London to Scotland, each
a day’s march from the next. They were set up at the
end of the thirteenth century by King Edward the First
of England, to commemorate the last journey of his
beloved Queen—his <i lang="fr">Chère Reine</i>—who died while
accompanying him upon a campaign against the Scots.
At each stopping-place on his homeward journey the
King erected one of these crosses to mark the spot where
the Queen’s body lay that night. Many have perished,
but you can still trace some of them along the Great
North Road—Neville’s Cross, Waltham Cross, and
finally <i lang="fr">Chère Reine</i> Cross, or Charing Cross. That
strikes the imagination. So do Aldgate, Aldersgate,
Moorgate, London Wall, and other streets which go
back to the days when London really was a walled city.</p>

<p>But a walk around London repays itself. There is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
Cleopatra’s Needle on the Embankment—the veteran
among all monuments of the world, except perhaps
its sister in Central Park, New York. It was in existence
fifteen hundred years before Christ, in the city of Heliopolis.
It looked down upon the Palace and Court of
Queen Cleopatra in Alexandria. After that it lay prostrate
in the sands of the Egyptian desert for another
fifteen hundred years. It was finally presented to the
British Government by the Khedive of Egypt. It was
towed to England on a raft, and was nearly lost during
a storm in the Bay of Biscay. Recently, the Zeppelins
have tried dropping bombs on it, as you can see for
yourself. But a mere bomb or two is nothing to a veteran
with a constitution like that.</p>

<p>In Warwickshire, around Stratford and the Forest of
Arden, you will find yourself in Shakespeare’s country.
At Gerrard’s Cross William Penn is buried. In the old
days a watch was kept on the grave, as certain patriotic
Americans considered that the proper place for William
Penn to be buried was Pennsylvania, and tried to give
practical effect to this pious opinion.</p>

<p>Scotland, if you happen to find yourself there, is entirely
different from England. England is flat or undulating,
and except in the manufacturing districts, is
given up mainly to cornfields and pasture land. Scotland,
especially in the north, is cut up into hills and glens.
Not such hills as you possess in Colorado, or Nevada,
or the Northwest. There is no Pike’s Peak, no Shasta,
no Rainier. The highest mountain in the British Isles—Ben
Nevis—is only a little over four thousand feet
high, but naturally Scotsmen think a good deal of it.</p>

<p>Scotland is a great battle-ground. The Scot has always
been fighting some one. There was perpetual warfare
upon the border from the earliest days. The Romans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
who were business men, built a wall right across England
from Newcastle to Carlisle, to keep the Scots out. They
failed, as you will find out for yourself, when you study
a list of British Cabinet Ministers; but you can see parts
of the wall still. Later, there were everlasting border
raids, from one side or the other, maintained as a tradition
by the great families of that region—the Percys,
the Douglases, the Maxwells, the Elliotts. Besides this,
various English kings tried to conquer Scotland. Sometimes
one side would win a battle, sometimes the other,
but no victory was lasting. At last, in 1707, the Act of
Union was passed, and Scotland and England came
under one central Government. Unfortunately, the
Highlanders of the north were not consulted in the
arrangement, and they put up two rebellions of their
own. Prince Charles Edward, the last of the Stuarts,
actually invaded England, and got as far as Derby. He
was defeated, but the rebellion smouldered on for years
among the Highland glens. The chain of forts along the
Caledonian Canal to-day—Fort George, Fort Augustus,
Fort William, now peaceful holiday resorts—is a
reminder of that time. But those days are all over now,
and for nearly two centuries English and Scottish soldiers
have fought side by side all over the world. Ireland
was united to England and Scotland by a similar Act of
Union in 1800. This event, as you may possibly have
heard, has provided a fruitful topic of conversation ever
since.</p>

<h3>IV. Our Climate</h3>

<p>Then there is our weather. An Englishman never
knows on going to work in the morning whether to take
a palm-leaf hat, or a fur overcoat, or a diving-suit. The
trouble is that our weather arrives too suddenly. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
are an island in the middle of the ocean, and most of
our weather comes in from the Atlantic, where there is
no one to watch it. Our weather prophets simply have
to take a chance. That is all. With you it is different.
Your weather travels across a continent three thousand
miles wide. You can see it coming, and telegraph to the
next State what to expect.</p>

<p>So, if you are spending a day’s leave in London, and
walk out of blazing sunshine at one end of the street
into a thunderstorm at the other—well, have a heart,
and put it down to the War. We will try to fix things for
you when peace comes. But we cannot promise. Anyway,
in peace-time we can always wear rubbers.</p>

<p>That is all about British weather.</p>

<h3>V. Our Transportation</h3>

<p>Then there are our railroads. These, like our boxed-in
passenger coaches and little four-wheel freight cars,
tickle you to death, I know. The compartment system is
a national symptom. An Englishman loves one thing
above all others, and that is to get a railway compartment
to himself. Nobody knows why, but he does.
Probably the craving arises from his inability to converse
easily with strangers. That inability is passing
away. I shall speak of it later. But the three-class system
is a relic of antiquity. Fifty years ago there were
three grades of comfort in British railroad travelling.
You could have your family horse-coach lashed upon an
open railroad truck and attached to the train. You thus
travelled in your own carriage, or chaise. I do not know
what happened to the horses. This was the usual custom
of the grand folk of those days. Or you could travel by
ordinary railway coaches, without cushions or windows.
Or you could pack yourself into an open freight truck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
much as soldiers on the Western Front are packed to-day,
and so reach your destination with other merchandise.</p>

<p>That has all gone now. Practically the only difference
between first, second, and third class in these days
is a difference of price—which means elbow-room.
(Second class, by the way, has almost entirely died out.)
The three classes are almost equal in comfort, especially
just now, when the War has abolished nearly all dining-cars
and sleepers. Our sleeping-car system never
amounted to much, anyway. The journeys were too
short to make it necessary for such as were travelling
by night (and they were comparatively few) to go to
bed. The lordly Pullman car is almost unknown here.</p>

<p>I said just now that we used to be proud of our railroads
in time of peace. We are doubly proud of them
to-day in the stress of War. They passed automatically
into Government hands the day the War broke out, and
they have given our whole country a lesson in the art of
carrying on. Thousands of their employees are away in
the trenches; hundreds of their locomotives and freight
cars are in France or Mesopotamia or Palestine, enlisted
for the duration. You will notice them when you get
over, marked R.O.D. (Railway Operating Department).
They have all come from England. Miles of tracks here
have been torn up and conveyed bodily overseas. There
is little labour available to execute repairs, and none to
build new stock. There is a shortage of coal, a shortage
of oil, and no paint. Passenger services have been cut
down by a half, and fares raised fifty per cent; yet the
traffic is still enormous, and the strain on the depleted
staffs is immense. But they manage somehow. Men who
have long earned their retirement remain in service,
while boys and women do the rest. Carry on!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span></p>

<h3>VI. Our Gopher Runs</h3>

<p>Then comes our substitute for your Subway, and
street-car system generally. In London you will notice
that there are two kinds of Subway—the so-called
Underground, or shallow transit, and the deep Tubes.
The system is so complicated, owing to the shape of
London, that it has been found impossible to have a
one-price ticket such as prevails everywhere in the
United States.</p>

<p>The Underground is the oldest underground railroad
in the world. You probably gathered that for yourself
the first time you saw it. Twenty-five years ago its
trains were drawn by ordinary steam locomotives,
which were supposed to consume their own smoke. Perhaps
they did, but it must have leaked out again somewhere.</p>

<p>The old Underground Railway of London got nearer
to the ordinary conception of hell than anything yet
invented. Stations and trains were lit by feeble gas
or oil lamps; all glass was covered over with a film of
soot, and the brightest illumination was provided by
the glow of the locomotive furnaces as the train rumbled
asthmatically into a station. The atmosphere was a
mixture of soot, smoke, sulphur, and poison gas. The
trains were on the box-compartment system, and small
compartments at that. The train usually waited two or
three minutes in each station (instead of ten seconds as
now), and it required a full hour to travel from King’s
Cross to Charing Cross. It was impossible to see to read
a newspaper, so that passengers, to pass the time, used
to rob, assault, and occasionally murder one another.
With the coming of electric traction the old Underground
was cleaned up and refurnished. At the same
time, the Tubes were constructed away down in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
London clay, where there could be no interference from
oozy gravel, or gas mains, or sewers.</p>

<p>The chief trouble about the Tubes is that no one
knows where they are. Of course, every one knows where
the <em>stations</em> are. For instance, every Londoner knows
where Piccadilly Circus Station is—the surface station.
But where is the actual subterranean station? Or rather,
where are the two stations, because at this point two
roads cross, and each has its own subterranean station.
Ah! They certainly are not where simple folk, like you
and me, would expect them to be—under Piccadilly
Circus. If they were, you would find them at the foot
of the elevator. But that would be too easy. It would
make Londoners fat and lazy, leading the sedentary life
they do, to step straight into the train. So they have to
walk about a mile. Where to, no one knows. But there
is a school of philosophers which believes that a good
many of the Tube stations have no subterranean stations
at all. One subterranean is shared jointly by several
surface stations. A short circular train ride is provided,
just to furnish the necessary illusion, and the
passenger, having really walked to his destination, steps
out of the train well satisfied, and goes up the right
elevator under the impression that he has been carried
there. That is our Tube system as far as modern research
has been able to fathom it. Of course, an Englishman
could never have thought out such a good practical joke
as these Tubes. The entire system was projected and
constructed by an American.</p>

<h3>VII. Our National Joke</h3>

<p>But we have a sense of humour all the same. Our
money system, like our joint system of weights and
measures, is, as you very properly observe, a practical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
joke. It dates back to the time when an Englishman
bought his Sunday dinner with a pound of rock. It is
bound to go soon, and make way for the decimal system,
just as inches and feet and yards are already making
way in this country for metres and centimetres.
Meanwhile we have got to put up with it.</p>

<p>The main points for an American to remember are—firstly,
that a shilling over here, despite war scarcity,
will still buy rather more than a quarter will buy in
New York; and secondly, the necessity of keeping
clearly in mind the difference between a half-crown and
a two-shilling piece. Even taxi-drivers do not always
know the difference. If you give them half a crown
they will frequently hand you change for a two-shilling
piece.</p>

<h3>VIII. Ourselves</h3>

<p>Lastly, ourselves. This chapter is going to be the most
difficult.</p>

<p>Last year I met an American soldier in London. He
was one of the first who had come over. I asked his
impressions. He said:</p>

<p>“I have been in London three days, and not a soul
has spoken to me.”</p>

<p>And therein was summed up the fundamental difference
between our two nations. In the United States
people like to see one another and talk to one another,
and meet fresh people. If a stranger comes to town,
reporters interview him as he steps off the train. Americans
prefer when travelling to do so in open cars. At
home their living-room doors are usually left open.
Every room stands open to every other. In their clubs
and hotels there are few private rooms. In their business
houses the head of the firm, the staff, and the clerks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
frequently work together in one great hall. If any partitions
exist they are only table-high or they are made of
glass. Plenty of light, plenty of air, plenty of publicity.
That is America.</p>

<p>Now over here, somehow, we are different. I said before
that an Englishman’s ambition in life was to get a
compartment to himself. That principle, for good or ill
prevails through all our habits. On the railroad we
travel in separate boxes. At home all our rooms have
doors, and we keep them shut. (This by the way, is
chiefly in order to get warm, for there is no central
heating.) In most of our clubs there are rooms where no
one is allowed to speak. They are crowded with Englishmen.
Only a few years ago one never thought of dining
in a restaurant except when travelling. If he did, he
always asked for a private room. If you dine at Simpson’s
in the Strand to-day you will still see a relic of the
custom in the curious boxed-in compartments which
enclose some of the tables. In our business houses the
head of the department is concealed in one hutch, the
partners in another. The chief clerk has one too. The
other clerks may have to work in one room; but each
clerk cherishes just one ambition, and that is to rise
high enough in the business to secure honourable confinement
in a hutch of his own.</p>

<p>For the same reason every Englishman keeps a fence
round his garden—be it castle or cottage garden—just
to show that it is his garden and no one else’s. And
if you look into any old English parish church you will
see the same thing. Every family has its own pew; the
humblest pew has a door, and when the family gets
inside the pew it shuts the door. Some of the pews have
curtains around them as well. The occupant can see the
minister, and the minister can see him. The rest of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
congregation are as invisible to him as he is to them.
No one in the congregation resents this at all. They are
rather proud of the custom. It represents to them only
what is right and proper, the principle of a compartment
to one’s self.</p>

<p>And so a nation which has lived for centuries upon
this plan is not a nation which enters readily or easily
into conversation outside its own particular compartment.
But how was I to explain or excuse such a state
of mind to my American soldier friend? Let me say
right here that this constrained behaviour does not arise
from churlishness, or want of good-will. Even the Germans
admit that. A German philosopher once said, with
considerable truth for a German: “The Englishman is a
cold friend, but a good neighbour. He may shut himself
up with his property, but he will never dream of invading
yours.” This statement is only partially correct.
The Englishman is one of the warmest-hearted and most
hospitable of men. But he is a bad starter—a bad
starter in War, Love, Business, and, above all, Conversation.
Once get him started, and he refuses to leave off.
But you must start him first. And you are doing it.</p>

<p>The Englishman’s passion for his own compartment
goes back a very, very long way, right into the centuries.
It goes back to the days when we lived in tribes and
every tribe kept to itself, and an Englishman’s house
was his castle—especially if the house were a one-room
mud hut. That makes us what we are to this day. Also
we are cooped up in a small island, and most of us have
never left it. No Englishman ever speaks to another
Englishman if he can help it. This is partly the old tribal
instinct, partly laziness, and partly fear of a rebuff.
Also, it may involve explanations, and an Englishman
would rather be scalped than explain. So he saves trouble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>
all round by burying himself in a newspaper and saying
nothing.</p>

<p>That by the way. But the main object of this little
book is to make you welcome to England, whoever you
may be, and to show you why it is that in our inarticulate
and undemonstrative English way, we love our
small country just as you love your big continent.</p>

<div class="verse">This precious stone set in a silver sea;</div>
<div class="verse">This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">That is how William Shakespeare felt about this “right
little tight little island” three hundred years ago, in
days when our nation was fighting for its life, neither
for the first nor for the last time, against overwhelmingly
superior forces. And we hope that when you go
back safe and victorious, as we pray God you may, to
your own beautiful land, you will carry with you a little
of that same feeling, and a real understanding of the
passionate sentiment that lies beneath it.</p>

<p>So we bid you welcome. And we ask you, our honoured
guests, to do all you can to get into close touch with
the habits and point of view of our country, both here
and upon that battle-front whither you are bound, to
play your own splendid part in the Great Game.</p>

<p>We are never going back to the old days when Englishmen,
Scotsmen, Irishmen, Canadians, Australians,
and Americans sat each in their own compartment, and
thanked God that they had it to themselves. We English-speaking
races have got together over this War. We have
lost terribly, but we are gaining much. We are rubbing
shoulders in London, and Paris, and countless other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
places, and we are rubbing the knobs and the angles off
one another, good and plenty. It is not always easy or
comfortable to have knobs rubbed off you, and the
process sometimes involves a little friction; but we must
be prepared for that.</p>

<p>For instance, we all speak English, but we all pronounce
it in different ways. Well, why not? Hitherto we
have been inclined to assume that the other man was
talking like that to annoy us. That is one of the knobs
that has to be rubbed off—intolerance of trivial
matters of taste and habit. To-day, under the most
searching test in the world—the test of comradeship
in the face of battle and sudden death—we are acquiring
a profound respect for one another. When we have
acquired just one other thing—tolerance for one another’s
point of view—we shall have laid the foundation
of an understanding which is going to hold us all
up through some difficult times hereafter. Getting this
old world back on to a peace basis, after the Kaiser has
been put where he belongs, is going to call for all our
courage, sincerity, and loyalty to our common ideals.
When that period of Reconstruction comes—and it
may come sooner than we think—the first plank in its
platform must be a solid understanding between the two
English-speaking races. They, at least, must speak with
one voice, or the whole fabric will fall to the ground.</p>

<p>Our two nations can never hope entirely to understand
one another. Neither can they expect always to
see eye to eye. Their national personalities are too
robust. But to-day their sons are learning to know the
worst of one another and the best of one another and
the invincible humanity of one another. With that
knowledge will come—if we have the will—tolerance
of one another’s point of view. We must get that. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
are thousands of reasons why, but to you, soldiers and
sailors, I am only going to mention one.</p>

<p>When the Victory comes, we shall enjoy its rewards.
But all the while we shall be conscious that we have
not won these entirely by ourselves. We shall in great
measure have inherited them from men who have not
lived to enjoy the fruits of their own sacrifice—men
whom we have left behind, in France, Belgium, and
Italy; in Asia and Africa; whose bones cover the ocean
floor—men who gave everything that the Cause might
live. To these we shall desire to raise a lasting memorial.
We can best do that by building up a fabric of understanding
on the foundation which they laid, so truly,
with their own lives. If we do that—and only if we do
that—our Dead can sleep in peace; for they will know
that what they died for was worth while, and above all
that we, their heritors, <em>have kept faith with them</em>—</p>

<h1>The Last Million</h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_ONE">CHAPTER ONE<br />
<span class="smaller">THE ARGONAUTS</span></h2>

<p>A ship is sailing on the sea—a tall ship, with several
masts and an imposing array of smokestacks.
She is moving at a strictly processional pace, with
a certain air of professional boredom. In fact, the
disconsolate hissing of her steam escape-pipes intimates
quite plainly that she is accustomed to
a livelier life than this. But a convoy belongs to
the straitest sect of Labour-Unionism: its pace
is regulated to that of the slowest performer; so
ocean greyhounds in such company must restrain
themselves as best they may.</p>

<p>All around her steam other ships. They are
striped, spotted, and ringstraked as to their hulls,
smokestacks, and spars in a manner highly gratifying
to that school of unappreciated geniuses, the
Futurists,—or Cubists, or Vorticists, or whatever
the malady is called,—but exasperating to the
submerged Hun, endeavouring to calculate knottage
and obtain ranging-points through a perplexed
periscope. On the outer fringe of the flotilla
fuss the sheep-dogs—the escorting warships.</p>

<p>If you seek to ascertain the nationality of our
tall ship, by internal evidence, you will probably
begin by observing certain notices painted up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
about the decks and cabins, requesting you to keep
off the bridge, or to refrain from throwing cigar-ends
on the deck, or not to leave this tap running.
You will next observe that these notices are inscribed
in English, French, and another language.
What language, it is impossible to say, for some
one has pasted a strip of blank paper over the inscription
in every case. But it is easy to guess. In
the depths, here and there, German is still spoken;
but upon the face of the broad ocean it is a dead
language.</p>

<p>Talking of nationalities, you will further observe
that these ships all fly the Union Jack. But they
are crowded with American soldiers. There must
be thousands of these soldiers. They swarm everywhere—bunched
on deck, peering through portholes,
or plastering the rigging like an overflow of
mustard sauce, which in truth they are. They are
more than that. They are a portent. They are a
symbol. They are a testimonial—to the Kaiser;
for has not that indefatigable bungler by his own
efforts brought about a long-overdue understanding
between all the English-speaking people in the
world?</p>

<p>Above all, they are a direct answer to a particular
challenge.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago the Men at the Top in Germany
got together and held what is known in military
circles as a pow-wow. A condensed report of
their deliberations would have read something like
this:</p>

<p>“Yes, Majesty, the Good Old German God is undoubtedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
on the side of our Army. Still, the fact
remains that we have not yet achieved anything,
after three-and-a-half years of war, really worth
while.… <em>Belgium</em>, <em>Serbia</em>, <em>Roumania</em>, <em>Russia</em>?
Yes, no doubt. Each of those countries has now
received the true reward of her stupidity and presumption;
but none of them ever offered any serious
difficulty from a military point of view, except
Russia; and the credit for her collapse was due far
more to our internal agents than to our external
military pressure.… No, Hindenburg, I haven’t
forgotten Tannenberg; but you haven’t done
very much <em>since</em> then (except get gold nails
knocked into yourself), and what you have accomplished
has been chiefly under—ahem!—<em>my</em> direction.…
No, no, I am not really pinning orchids
on myself—not yet, anyway. I am merely trying
to be candid and frank: in short, I am reminding
you that you are only a figurehead. You know what
irreverent people call you—‘General What-do-you-Say!’</p>

<p>“… Yes, Your Imperial Highness, your consummate
generalship at Verdun undoubtedly
achieved an historic victory over the French; but
you will forgive me for pointing out that your casualties
were at least twice as numerous as theirs,
and that the ground which you captured has since
been regained.… <em>Submarines</em>? My good Von
Capelle, your submarines are as obsolete as our
late lamented friend Von Tirpitz. <em>Justify my statement?</em>
In a moment.… Yes, Majesty, the British
Army failed utterly to break our line at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Somme, but they and the French took seventy
thousand of our best troops prisoner, and we had
to execute a ‘strategic’ retirement which lost us
about a thousand square miles of French soil. Not
much of a performance for the German Army—the
<em>German Army</em>—to put up against a mob of
half-trained mercenaries! We managed to delude
our people into the belief that we had scored a
great military triumph in so doing, but the German
nation, excellent though their discipline is,
are not likely to go on swallowing that stuff forever.
<em>You</em> know that, better than most, Hertling! Bethmann-Hollweg
knew it too: he was no match for
Liebknecht, although he did lock him up.…</p>

<p>“And what of the situation since the Somme?
Haig is within ten miles of Ostend, and has captured
practically the whole of the Paschendaele
Ridge.… <em>The Eastern Front?</em> Nothing matters
in this war except the <em>Western</em> Front. What are we
going to do about that?… <em>Your Majesty will assume
supreme command?</em> Splendid!… <em>And break
the Western Front?</em> Colossal! That was just what I
was about to suggest. Now for the plan of campaign,
which I do not doubt Your Majesty has
already sketched out.… Perhaps Your Majesty
will permit Hindenburg and myself to remain here
a few moments longer, while you unfold it? We
need not detain His Imperial Highness the Crown
Prince. He is the man of Action: his task will come
later. (<em>For Heaven’s sake, Von Hertling, get him
out of here, or our two military geniuses will be
at loggerheads in five minutes!</em>)</p>

<p>“… And now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Majesty, you suggest—?… That is a superb
plan; but it appears to me—I mean, to Hindenburg—that
you—we—are rating one of the
nations opposed to us too lightly.… Yes, Your
Majesty, I know you are going to stand no nonsense
from them <em>after</em> the War,—in fact, you
warned their Ambassador, most properly, if I may
say so, to that effect,—but would it not be a good
move, just as a preliminary, to stand no nonsense
from them <em>during</em> the War?… <em>Too far away?
They can’t get over?</em> Well—here are the approximate
numbers of the American troops already in
France. And there are a lot of them in England too.…
<em>Rather surprising?</em> Yes. Indeed, quite a creditable
feat for an unwarlike nation. I shall show these
figures to Von Capelle: it will justify what I said
about his submarines: in fact, it will annoy him extremely.
And there are more coming. They are
pouring over faster and faster. I shall tell him that
too.… <em>But the Americans have had no experience
of intensive warfare? And they have fallen behind
with their constructive programme—aeroplanes and
artillery?</em> Quite so. And, therefore, taking these
facts into consideration, I—Hindenburg—Your
Majesty will doubtless decide that our only chance
is to concentrate in overwhelming strength, here
and now, against <em>one</em> of the two enemy forces at
present opposed to us, and destroy that force in detail
before the Americans can throw any considerable
body of troops into the line.… <em>Expensive?</em>
Undoubtedly.… <em>No one has ever succeeded during
this War in breaking a properly organized trenchline?</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Agreed; but only because no one has yet been
able or willing to pay the necessary price. The
British might have done it on the Somme, but
Haig was too squeamish about the lives of his men.
British generals are handicapped in their military
dispositions by a public opinion which happily
does not exist in our enlightened Fatherland. I—Hin—Your
Majesty can afford to do it. With all
these unemployed Divisions from the Russian
Front, we can go to the limit in the matter of casualties.…
<em>How many?</em> Well, I think we can afford
to lose a million men—say a million.… Yes,
indeed, Majesty, your heart must bleed at the
prospect; but after all, it is for the ultimate good
of Humanity.… ‘<em>One cannot make omelettes without
breaking eggs?</em>’ Admirable! Your Majesty’s
felicity of phrase shows no falling off, I perceive.
And yet the Americans talk of their Woodrow Wilson!
Besides, it will be a million less to make trouble
for Us after the War. Now, I suppose we are all
agreed on the foe to be crushed?… <em>The British?</em>
Naturally. The British! The time has come to drive
them into the sea. Haig has recently extended his
line twenty-eight miles—rather reluctantly, too.
He has had to send troops to Italy, and he had
heavy casualties in Belgium last autumn. Twenty-seven
thousand killed, in fact. Still, without a
supreme commander, you cannot blame the various
Allied leaders for ‘passing the buck’ to one
another, as the Yankees say. We can accumulate
troops on his front—veterans from Russia—sufficient
to outnumber him by at least three to one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
That should suffice, if we stand by our decision
about casualties. We will strike hard at his new
positions, before his artillery has had time to register
thoroughly. We will annihilate his front system
of trenches by an intensive bombardment, while
our new long-range gas-shells take his rest-billets by
surprise and demoralize his Divisional and Corps
Reserves. And I think, Majesty, that we have been
a little punctilious about things like the Red Cross.
After all, hospitals are a mere sentimental handicap
to the efficient waging of war. Our new bombing
aeroplanes might be instructed to deal faithfully
with these, especially as the fool English have
organized no preparation for their defence. Yes, I—we—Your
Majesty will drive the whole pack
of them into the sea this time! The French, isolated,
can then be handled at leisure; and with Calais,
Boulogne, and Havre in our hands the Americans
will find that they have come too late. In fact,
we can pick them off as they arrive. Thus it is that
Your Majesty, like Cæsar and Napoleon, separates
his enemies and then destroys them one by
one.… <i lang="la">Divide et Impera!</i> Exactly! Most happily
put, Your Majesty!”</p>

<p class="tb">And it was so—up to a point. Ludendorff’s
plan was adopted. The necessary concentration of
troops was effected with admirable secrecy and
promptitude, and the parallel enterprises of sweeping
the British Army into the sea and expending a
million German lives were duly inaugurated. The
latter undertaking succeeded better than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
former: the line sagged and wavered; it was pushed
here and there; but it never broke. Still, the strain
was terrible, as news arrived of Monchy gone,
Wytschaete gone, Messines gone, Kemmel gone; of
Bapaume, Albert, Armentières, Bailleul, all gone—little
hills and little towns all of them, but big
and precious in certain unimportant eyes because
of their associations. But the worst news never arrived.
Instead, there came one morning the tale of
an all-day assault by the Hun, delivered in mass
from Meteren to Voormezeele, every wave of which
had been broken and hurled back by impregnable
rocks of French and British infantry. So disastrous
was the failure of that tremendous lunge that the
enemy drew off with his dead and his shame for
several weeks, and the non-stop run to Calais was
withdrawn from the time-table until further notice.</p>

<p>But the matter could not be left here. The Boche
had laid a terrible stake on the table, and was
bound to redeem it or perish. Plainly he would try
again—maybe at some fresh point; but again. Already
there were mutterings of trouble on the
French Front. That he would break the line—the
line which he had failed to break at Verdun in
1916, and at Ypres in 1914—seemed incredible;
but he might succeed in straining it beyond the
limits of perfect recovery; and if that happened,
Ludendorff’s boast that America would arrive too
late might be justified.</p>

<p>Hence the present Armada. It is only one of
many. Transports have been crossing the Atlantic
for months now, but never upon such a scale as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
this. There are thousands of soldiers in this convoy
alone—men physically splendid, with nearly a
year’s training behind them. They are going over—Over
There—in answer to the call. Russia has
stepped out of the scale, so America must step in at
once if Prussianism is to kick the beam. Here they
are—a sight to quicken the pulse—the New
World hastening to redress the balance of the Old.</p>

<span class="smaller">SHIP’S COMPANY</span></h2>

<p>However, we have not reached our destination
yet; which is just as well, for at present we are fully
occupied in assimilating our new surroundings. To
tell the truth, some of us have a good deal to assimilate.
There is young Boone Cruttenden, for instance.</p>

<p>Little more than a year ago he was preparing to
settle down in his ancestral home in Kentucky,
there to prop the declining years of an octogenarian
parent, Colonel Harvey Cruttenden, known
in far-back Confederate days as one of General
Sam Wheeler’s hardest-riding disciples. But President
Wilson had upset the plans of Boone Cruttenden
for all time, by inviting him and certain others
to step forward and help make the World Safe for
Democracy. Boone was one of the first to accept
the invitation.</p>

<p>Several strenuous months at a training-camp of
the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps followed, and
in due course he found himself, with a gilded metal
strip on either shoulder, communicating his slender
knowledge of the art of war to drafted persons who
possessed no knowledge of the subject at all—just
as thousands of other young men of the right spirit
were doing all over the country, and just as thousands
of other young men of similar spirit had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
doing for more than three years in another country
three thousand miles away.</p>

<p>“It was something fierce at first,” he confided to
Miss Frances Lane, a United States Army nurse,
proceeding, in company with ninety-nine others, to
a Base Hospital in France.</p>

<p>By rights Miss Lane and her companions should
not have been taking chances on a transport at all.
She should have been crossing the Atlantic in a
stately white-painted hospital ship, with the Red
Cross emblazoned on its sides, immune by all the
laws of God and Man from hostile attack. But the
Red Cross makes the Hun see red. Therefore it is
found safer in these days to adjust life-jackets over
the splints and bandages of wounded men and send
them across the water, together with the indomitable
sisterhood which tends them, protected by
something that makes a more intelligible appeal to
<i lang="de">Kultur</i> than the mere symbol of Christianity.</p>

<p>“It was something fierce,” repeated Boone
Cruttenden.</p>

<p>“Tell me!” commanded Miss Lane, with an air of
authority which Boone found extremely attractive.</p>

<p>“Well, in the training-camps the main proposition
was to make the boys understand what they
were there for. They were full of enthusiasm, but
very few of them had taken any interest in the early
part of the war, and we were all a long way from
Europe, anyhow. They were willing enough to
fight, but naturally they wanted to know what
they were fighting for. Even when we told them,
they weren’t too wise. Two or three men of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
company could neither read nor write; another
man knew the name of his home town, but not the
name of his State. The map of Europe was nothing
in his young life. Then, lots of them thought we
were going to fight the Yankees again, and whip
them this time!”</p>

<p>Boone’s eyes flashed, and for a moment he forgot
all about European complications. He was his
father’s son all through. But a certain tensity in
the atmosphere recalled him to realities.</p>

<p>“I guess you aren’t a Southerner?” he observed
apologetically.</p>

<p>“Massachusetts,” replied Miss Lane coldly.</p>

<p>Boone Cruttenden offered a laboured expression
of regret, and proceeded:</p>

<p>“Then they didn’t like saluting, or obeying orders
on the jump. Neither did I, for that matter. It
seemed undemocratic.”</p>

<p>“So it is,” affirmed Miss Lane sturdily.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know. We certainly made much
quicker progress with our training once we had gotten
the idea. Our instructors were very particular
about it, too—both French and British. There
was an English sergeant—well, the boys used to
come running a hundred yards to see him salute an
officer. I tell you, it tickled them to death, at first.
Next thing, they were all trying to do it too.”</p>

<p>“What was it like?”</p>

<p>Boone rose from his seat upon the deck, stiffened
his young muscles, and offered a very creditable
reproduction of the epileptic salute of the British
Guardsman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“Like that,” he said.</p>

<p>“I’m not surprised they ran,” commented Miss
Lane.</p>

<p>“Still,” continued Boone appreciatively, “that
sergeant was a bird. At the start, we regarded him
as a pure vaudeville act. He talked just like a stage
Englishman, for one thing. For another, a German
bullet had gone right through his face—in at
one cheek and out at the other—and that didn’t
help make a William Jennings Bryan of him. But
William J. had nothing on him; neither had Will
Rogers, for that matter. He would stand there in
front of us and put over a line of stuff that made
everybody weak with laughing—everybody, that
is, except the fellow he was talking to. I shall never
forget the first morning we held an Officers’ Instruction
Class. There were about forty of us. Old
man Duckett—that was his name; Sergeant Instructor
Duckett—marched us around, and put
us through our paces. We meant to show him something—we
were a chesty bunch in those days—so
we gave him what we imagined was a first-class
West Point show. (Not that any of us had been at
West Point.) When we had done enough, he lined
us up, and said: ‘Well, gentlemen, I have run over
your points, and before dismissin’ the parade I
should like to say that I only wish the President of
the United States was here to see you. If he <em>did</em>
catch sight of you, I know that his first words would
be—”Thank Gawd, from the bottom of my heart,
we’ve got a Navy!“’”</p>

<p>To Boone and Miss Lane now enter others.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
(This is a trial to which Master Boone is growing
accustomed, for Miss Lane is quite the prettiest
girl on the ship.) Among them we note one Jim
Nichols, who, previous to America’s entry into the
War, has worked upon the New Orleans Cotton
Exchange “ever since he can remember.” There is
also Major Powers, wearing the ribbon of the Spanish
War medal. There are two Naval officers, crossing
over to pursue submarines. Until they begin,
Miss Lane makes a very pleasant substitute. And
there is a British officer who walks with a limp—Captain
Norton—returning from a spell of duty
as Military Instructor in a Texas training-camp.</p>

<p>Miss Lane, with the instinct of a true hostess,
turns to the stranger.</p>

<p>“We were talking about our rookies, Captain,”
she announces. “How did they compare with your
Kitchener’s Army?”</p>

<p>“Very much the same, Miss Lane, in the early
days. Fish out of the water, all of them. We had all
sorts—miners, shipbuilders, farm-hands, railway-men,
newspaper-boys—and not one of them knew
the smallest thing about soldiering. They knew
pretty well everything else, I admit. The ranks
were chock-full of experts—engineers, plumbers,
electricians, glass-blowers, printers, musicians. I
remember one of my men put himself down as an
‘egg-tester’—whatever that may be! An actor,
perhaps. But hardly one of them knew his right
foot from his left when it came to forming fours.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” said Major Powers. “My first consignment
of drafted men was a mixture of mountaineers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
from Tennessee—moonshiners, most of
them—and East-Side Jews from New York.
(I wonder who the blue-eyed boy at Washington
was who mixed ’em!) The moonshiners looked the
hardest lot of cases you ever set eyes on: they hated
discipline worse than poison; and an officer was
about as popular with them as a skunk at a picnic.
But they were as easy as pie: they were scared to
death half the time, by—what do you think?”</p>

<p>“The water-wagon?” suggested a voice.</p>

<p>“No—of getting lost! They could have found
their way blindfold over their own hills back home;
but they had never lived on a street before, and
those huge camps had them paralyzed. They said
the huts were all exactly alike—which was true
enough—and not one of them would stray fifty
yards from his own for fear he would not find it
again. Curious, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Almost exactly what happened with our
Scottish Highlanders,” said Norton. “But they
took quite kindly to city life in the end. Regular
clubmen, in fact. What about your East-Siders?”</p>

<p>“They were a more difficult proposition,” said
Powers. “In the first place, they didn’t want to
fight at all, whereas the moonshiners did. In fact,
the moonshiners didn’t care whom they fought, so
long as they fought somebody. They were like the
Irishman who asked: ‘Is this a private fight, or can
anybody join in?’ But the East-Siders were different.
Their discipline was right enough: in fact, the
average East-Side rookie usually acted towards an
officer as if he wanted to sell <em>him</em> something. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
they were city birds, born and bred. They were accustomed
to behave well when a cop was in sight;
but once around the corner you could not have
trusted them with their own salary. They didn’t
like country life, and they didn’t like the dark.
They were never really happy away from a street
with illuminated signs on it—and there aren’t
many of those in Texas. If you put one of the bunch
on sentry duty by himself in a lonely place, like as
not he’d get so scared he’d go skating around the
outskirts of the camp looking for cover. I once
rounded up four of my sentries from different posts,
all together in one pool-room. But discipline has
them nicely fixed now. By the way, you heard the
story of the Jew doughboy whose friends recommended
him to take a Commission?”</p>

<p>“No. Tell me!” commanded Miss Lane.</p>

<p>“He refused, on the ground that it would be too
difficult to collect. He said he might not be able
to keep tally of all the Germans he killed: besides,
his General might not believe him. Anyway, he
preferred a straight salary! Tell us some more of
your experiences, Captain.”</p>

<p>“They were much the same as yours,” said
Norton. “The trouble with Kitchener’s Army was
that practically every member of the rank-and-file
enlisted under the firm belief that Kitchener would
simply hand him a rifle and ammunition and pack
him off right away to the Front—whatever that
might be—to shoot the Kaiser. Their experiences
during the first six months—chiefly a course of
instruction in obedience and sobriety—was a bit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
of a jolt to them. But discipline told in the end. To-day
I believe most of them would rather have a
strict officer than an officer they could do what
they liked with. Leniency usually means inefficiency;
and inefficiency at the top of things usually
means irregular meals and regular casualties for
the men underneath!”</p>

<p>“What do you include under discipline, Captain?”
enquired that upholder of personal liberty,
Miss Lane, suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Little things, chiefly—things that don’t seem
to matter much. Shaving, and tidiness—”</p>

<p>“What, in a trench?” asked several young officers.
But Major Powers nodded his head approvingly.</p>

<p>“That is just what most of us ask who don’t
know,” he said. “But I have seen enough service to
have learned one thing, and that is that a dirty soldier
is a bad soldier, all the world over. If a man
is encouraged to neglect his personal appearance,
he starts to neglect his work—gets careless with
the cleaning of his rifle, and so forth. If a man
takes no pride in his appearance, he takes no pride
in his duty. The other way round, the best soldier
is the soldier who keeps himself smart.”</p>

<p>“That is just what I think,” interpolated Miss
Lane, virtuously. (She had succeeded during the
Major’s homily in surreptitiously powdering her
nose, and felt ready to take Florence Nightingale’s
place at a moment’s notice.)</p>

<p>“We certainly found it so,” said Norton. “In
fact, after a short experience of trench warfare we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
revived all the old peace-time stunts. The order was
given that every man in the trenches was to be
shaved by a certain hour each day. (Of course, if
the Boche attacked in mass, the ceremony was liable
to postponement.) In billets behind the line
every one was expected to make himself as smart
as possible—brush his uniform, shine his shoes,
and so on. The band played for an hour every evening.
Saluting and other little ceremonies like that
were insisted on. These things all together had a tremendous
effect. I don’t know why, but it was so.
For one thing, it made life behind the lines more
tolerable—more refreshing. In the line itself, it
made officers more concise in giving their orders,
and men more alert and intelligent in carrying
them out. In fact, the greater the fuss a regiment
made about its appearance—‘eye-wash,’ we
called it—the better its work in the field.”</p>

<p>“Things worked out that way with us too, even
in home training,” corroborated Powers.</p>

<p>“So I noticed. I was in four or five big camps, in
different States, and I found that the rate of progress
in training varied almost directly with the discipline.”</p>

<p>“Which camp did you like best?”</p>

<p>The British officer turned to Miss Lane, and
shook his head. “No, you don’t, Miss Lane!” he
replied. “I belong to the most tactless race in the
world, but I know enough to keep out of trouble
of that kind! I had a gorgeous time in <em>all</em> of them.”</p>

<p>At this point a timely bugle blew for boat drill,
and the harassed veteran stumped off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Boat drill occurs at frequent intervals, and is
still sufficient of a novelty to be regarded as an
amusement.</p>

<p>By all, that is, except the <i lang="fr">habitués</i>—the crew,
the stewards, and that anæmic race of troglodytes
which only emerges from the lower depths of the
ship under the stress of great emergency—the
army of dish-washers and potato-peelers. These
fall in at their posts with the half-ashamed self-consciousness
of big boys who have been compelled
by an undiscriminating hostess to participate
in children’s games. They grin sheepishly,
shiver ostentatiously in the fresh breeze, and offer
profane but amusing comments in an undertone to
one another.</p>

<p>But few of the present passengers have ever
been on board a ship before. Indeed, many of us
never saw the ocean until last week. War and its
appurtenances are for the present a game, full of
interesting surprises and wonderful thrills. It is
surprising, for instance, however good your appetite
may have been in camp, to find how much
more you can eat on board ship; and it is thrilling,
if you happen to be a rustic beauty from a very
small town in Central Iowa, to find yourself dancing
the one-step, in a life-jacket, with a total
stranger in uniform, upon an undulating deck to
the music of a full military band.</p>

<p>So most of us have entered upon the business
with all the misguided enthusiasm of the gentleman
who once blacked himself all over to play
“Othello.” Some of us sleep in our clothes; others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
carry all their valuables about their person; not a
few donned patent life-saving contraptions before
we cleared Sandy Hook. But no one appears the
least nervous: there is a pleasurable excitement
about everything. And we listen with intense respect
to the blood-curdling reminiscences of the
crew, particularly the stewards. All our cabin
stewards have been torpedoed at least three times,
and every single one of them was on board the
<i>Lusitania</i> when she was sunk. The survivors of the
<i>Lusitania</i> must be almost as numerous by this
time as the original ship’s company of the <i>Mayflower</i>.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_THREE">CHAPTER THREE<br />
<span class="smaller">THE LOWER DECK</span></h2>

<p>If you clamber down the accommodation ladder
on to the well-deck amidships, you will find yourself
in a world which will enable you to contemplate
War from yet another angle.</p>

<p>For a guide and director I can confidently recommend
Mr. Al Thompson, late of Springfield,
Illinois—“No, <em>sir</em>, not Massachusetts!” he will
be careful to inform you—now a seasoned ornament
of a Trench Mortar Battery.</p>

<p>“We sure are one dandy outfit,” he observes
modestly. “Two hundred roughnecks! I’ll make
you known to a few. There’s Eddie Gillette: you
seen him box last night, out on the forward deck
there? Yep? Well, you certainly seen something!”</p>

<p>We certainly had. Boxing is an ideal pastime for
a large, virile, and closely packed community, for
several reasons. In the first place, it requires very
little space. A twelve-foot ring will do: indeed,
towards the end of an exciting bout the combatants
can—or must—make shift with mere elbow-room.
In the second, the novice extracts quite as
much exercise and excitement from the sport as
the expert—possibly more. Thirdly and most important,
boxing fulfils the cardinal principle of
providing for the greatest good of the greatest
number, because it affords far more undiluted happiness
to the spectators than to the performers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Last night, for instance, when Mr. Hank Magraw
(weight two hundred pounds), a gladiator mainly
conspicuous for unruffled urbanity and entire ignorance
of the rules of boxing, growing a trifle restive
under the cumulative effect of three consecutive
taps upon the point of the chin from an opponent
half his size, suddenly gathered that gentleman
into his arms and endeavoured to stuff him down
one of those trumpet-mouthed ventilators which
lead to the stokehold, the spectators voiced their
appreciation by a vociferous encore.</p>

<p>A wonderful sight these spectators are. They are
banked up all around the well-deck, forming a
deep pit, in the bottom of which two boxers gyrate,
clash, and recoil like nutshells in a whirlpool.
Tier upon tier they rise—with their long, lean,
American bodies, and tense, brown, American
faces—seated in concentric circles on the deck
itself, perched on hatches and deck-houses and sky-lights,
clinging to davits and ventilators, or hanging
in clusters from the rigging—all yelling themselves
hoarse.</p>

<p>The “announcer”—one Buck Stamper—stands
for the moment at the bottom of the vortex.
With each of his muscular arms he encircles the
shrinking figure of a competitor, and introduces
the pair to the audience.</p>

<p>“Boys,” he bellows, in a voice which must be
easily audible in the surrounding transports, “one
of the English officers up there has come across
with—with—a ten-shilling certificate”—he releases
one of his <i lang="fr">protégés</i> in order to display a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
pink-and-white British treasury note—“to be awarded
to the winner of this bout.”</p>

<p>There is a little polite applause. Then a stentorian
voice enquires:</p>

<p>“How much is that—in money?”</p>

<p>There is a great roar of laughter. The announcer
retires, to seek an expert financier. A British marine
enlightens him, and he announces:</p>

<p>“’Bout two dollars-and-a-half. On my right I
have Ikey Zingbaum, of the Field Ambulance—”</p>

<p>The immediate conjunction of Ikey Zingbaum
and two-and-a-half dollars appeals to the crowd’s
sense of humour. When they have recovered, Buck
Stamper proceeds:</p>

<p>“On my left”—he thrusts forward a smooth-chinned,
pink-cheeked, lusty, country lad—“Miss
Sissy Smithers, what has got in among the boys by
mistake!”</p>

<p>Amid yells of delight the blushing Sissy shakes
hands with his tallow-faced opponent, and falls
promptly upon his neck. The pair, locked in a
complicated embrace, circle slowly round the ring,
feebly patting one another on the back. At the urgent
suggestion of the spectators the referee separates
them, caustically observing that this is a fight
and not a fox-trot. For a short time they stand uneasily
apart; then Ikey Zingbaum, stimulated possibly
by his supporters’ constant references to the
ten-shilling certificate, leans suddenly forward and
boxes his opponent’s ears. Miss Sissy, stung into
indignant activity, lunges out with all his strength
and counters fairly and squarely in the pit of Ikey’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
stomach. Mr. Zingbaum shuts up like a footrule,
and shoots stern-foremost into the thick of the
audience. He is extracted amid shouts of laughter,
groaning horribly, and receives first aid from a
dozen willing but inexperienced hands. Presently
he recovers sufficiently far to be informed that he
has been awarded the match—on a foul. Miss
Sissy, not ill-pleased with himself, modestly disappears.</p>

<p>“Yes,” continued Al Thompson, “you seen
something. Was you there when Eddie Gillette fit
that duck what we call Coca-Kola? No? I’m
sorry. Coca-Kola’s a Turk. Comes from Turkey, I
mean. Las’ winter, when he was fighting around
the Bowery, he would eat raw meat whenever he
could get it. Said it kept him kinder fit. Anyway,
he was put up las’ night against Eddie Gillette. We
picked on Ed because he was the best man in the
Trench Mortar Section, and Coca-Kola had been
winning out all the time for the Machine Gunners,
where he belonged, and they was blowing some.
Ed was giving away more than seventeen pounds of
weight, besides which the Turk was the sort of guy
that if he was short of money he would go up to a
person an’ say: ‘You give me two bits and I’ll let
you hit me on the jaw any place you like!’ That
was the kind of lobster Coca-Kola was, and gives
you some sort of an idea what Ed was up against!</p>

<p>“The match was to be ten rounds of two minutes
each. There was five dollars donated by an
officer for the winner, and some powerful side-bets.
But it was all over in one round. Eddie started by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
rushing in and giving the Turk a silly little tap on
the nose. That seemed to get the Turk’s goat, for
he went for Eddie like a cyclone, and rushed him
all around the ring for maybe a minute. At the end
of that he gave him a blow on the body that laid
him flat on the deck. We all thought Eddie was
gone for sure. The time-keeper had counted up to
five before he come to life at all. Then he began to
recover, very slow. At ‘seven’ he rolled over on his
face. The Turk, reckoning that Eddie was too dopy
to go on any more, just straddled around in the
middle of the ring, looking up to the deck above
for the officer that was donating the five bucks.
But at ‘nine’ Eddie was on his feet again, like a
streak. No one hardly saw him get up. All they did
see was Eddie <em>soak</em> the Turk under the point of the
jaw—which was well up in the air at the time.
Coca-Kola fairly knocked a groan out of the deck
when he struck it. It took them two hours to bring
him round. Gee, but it was some soak! Some of the
Machine Gun boys cut open Eddie’s glove after,
because they suspicioned he might have a chunk of
lead there. But there weren’t nothing there. No,
<em>sir</em>! Nothing but Eddie’s little old punch!”</p>

<p>We are presented both to the victorious Eddie
and the dethroned masticator of raw meat. The
latter is inclined to be taciturn; but the former,
true to national use and custom, is quite ready to
be interviewed.</p>

<p>Yes, this is his first trip across, but he is not seasick,
and does not expect to be. Reason; he has
spent twelve years on the Great Lakes, and a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
that can stand the up-and-down convulsions of,
say, Lake Michigan during a winter storm, need
not fear the spacious roll of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>“There’s a ten-thousand-ton ship has went
down there before now,” says Eddie, referring apparently
to Lake Michigan, “just because them
twisty seas has sheered the heads clean off her bolts
and opened her up. Kinder ripped her, I guess.
Every October owners raises the pay of all hands
on them ships fifteen per cent—raises it voluntary.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because the whole bunch would quit if they
didn’t!”</p>

<p>This does not sound like a very convincing example
of the voluntary system; but the great are
permitted to be inconsistent. Mr. Gillette, proceeding,
considers that life on board this ship is
tolerable, but the food monotonous. Another gentleman,
chewing tobacco, now joins the symposium.
He is introduced as Joe McCarthy, of Oklahoma.</p>

<p>“You said it!” he announces, referring apparently
to the food question. “Especially the coffee.
The stuff they serve on board this packet ain’t got
no kick to it.”</p>

<p>He is reminded that he has passed out of the
coffee belt, and that he is approaching a land of
tea-drinkers.</p>

<p>“Tea or coffee,” he rejoins, with the dogged persistence
of the professional grumbler, “it don’t
make no difference to me. And another thing. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
yer travelling by sea is a lonesome business. Give
me a railroad! There you can look out of the window
of the car and see folks waving their hands
to you; and presents of candy at the deepo, and
everything. While this”—he flings a disparaging
glance over the heaving Atlantic—“this is all the
same, all the time!”</p>

<p>“Well, Joe,” explains the fair-minded Al Thompson,
“I guess we <em>got</em> to travel to Europe this way,
seeing there ain’t no railroad across—leastways
not at present.”</p>

<p>But Mr. McCarthy refuses to be comforted.</p>

<p>“Europe!” he exclaims. “There y’ are! Europe—four
thousand miles from America! Some folks
must be darned anxious for war, if they got to send
us four thousand miles to find it!”</p>

<p>This last sentiment produces a distinct sensation.
It is adjudged by those who hear it to border
on pro-Germanism. Heads turn sharply in Joe’s
direction. A certain licence is permitted to professional
grouchers; but “knocking” the Cause is
the one thing that the New Crusaders will not permit.</p>

<p>That simple-hearted American, Al Thompson,
conveys the necessary reproof, in a manner which
more highly-placed diplomatists might envy.</p>

<p>“Listen, Joe,” he remarks: “that stuff don’t go
here. I know you been mighty seasick, and you’re
sore on the food, and the monotony, and the other
little glooms that come around on a slow trip like
this. But whenever <em>I</em> git sore on things just now,
like we all do, I just remember them dirty bums<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
over there marching through Belgium with little
babies on their bayonets; and then—well, all I
care about is <em>getting</em> over there and killing any guy
that calls himself a Dutchman. Let me kill a few
of them first—and, even if they kill me after, I
should worry!”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_FOUR">CHAPTER FOUR<br />
<span class="smaller">THE DANGER ZONE</span></h2>

<p>There are many other types on board. Here is one
at your elbow. He is a sentry, on Number Nine
post. His duties appear to be confined to scrutinizing
the ocean for periscopes. This is not a very
arduous task, for we are not in the danger zone at
present. Indeed, a good deal of this sentry’s time
appears to be spent in gazing over the taffrail
towards the setting sun—towards America. Possibly
he ought to be straining his eyes towards
France. But we are all human, especially the
American soldier boy, and this boy is unaffectedly
and avowedly homesick. Jim Cleaver’s thoughts
at the present moment are nowhere near Number
Nine post; they are centred upon a little township
called Potsdam, far away. This sounds good and
blood-thirsty: unfortunately this particular Potsdam
is not in Prussia, but “way up” somewhere in
the State of New York; and Jim’s imagination is
concerned less with the House of Hohenzollern
than with the House of Cleaver—particularly the
feminine portion thereof. Moreover, it happens to
be Sunday evening; and we all know what that
means.</p>

<p>At the other corner of the deck stands Antonio.
That is not his real name, but no matter. He will
inform you that he has already crossed the ocean—once.
A brief exercise in mental arithmetic will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
presently cause you to realize that Antonio cannot
have been born in America. This is so. He crossed
over ten years ago, in the steerage of an Austrian
Lloyd liner, outward bound from Trieste, on his
way from the sunny but unremunerative plains of
Lombardy, in search of a mysterious Eldorado
called Harlem, New York. And now here he is,
aged twenty-six, picked out by the groping hand of
the Selective Draft, on his way back again, to help
rend those same plains (among others) from the
Hun and restore them to their rightful owners. He
is quite cheerful at the prospect, though he would
sooner be with the Italian Army than with the
American. Not that he is lacking in patriotism
towards the land of his adoption, but—</p>

<p>“I gotta two brother over there,” he explains.
“Besides, here I gotta talka da Ingleese. Alla same,
I feela fine!”</p>

<p>Antonio is not the only man who is going back
with a personal interest in the European situation.
On a coil of rope on the well-deck, broad-faced and
Turanian, sits another young man. If Antonio’s
real name is difficult to pronounce, this man’s is
out of range altogether; for he is a Russian. He
is addressed indifferently as Clambakovitch or
Roughneckski.</p>

<p>“I live fifty miles from German border,” he
says. “I come over here seven years ago: I go
through Berlin and sail from Hamburg. Now the
Germans have my home. I do not hear from my
people for three years. So now I go home—through
Berlin again!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“And after that?”</p>

<p>After that, Clambakovitch Roughneckski’s plans
are perfectly definite. He is coming back to America—for
good. Already he is wedded to the soil
of Pennsylvania. Antonio’s views are the same.</p>

<p>The affection of her children for America is a
wonderful thing. Domestic or imported, it makes
no matter. To the native-born American, America
is still the little country—the little strip of coastline—which
stood up successfully to a dunder-headed
monarch in days when men did not govern
themselves: to the naturalized American, America
is the land which gave him his first real taste of
personal liberty. Each cherishes America to-day—the
one because he helped to make her free, the
other because she has made him free.</p>

<p>We are in the danger zone now. It is difficult to
realize that thrilling circumstance, because no one
seems to worry at all.</p>

<p>The same games of shuffle-board, bull-board,
chess, checkers, and bridge are in progress; each
day sees the same guard-mountings, parades, and
inspections; off duty, the same quantity of tobacco
and chewing-gum is being consumed. Only if the
ship is brought up short by a heavy sea, or an iron
door clangs suddenly in some distant stokehold,
are we conscious of any tension at all. For a moment
heads are turned, or conversation breaks. But
that is all. A year ago, old hands tell us, things were
different. There really was cause for nervousness.
But now, we are escorted, we are well-armed, and
the worst we need fear is a few hours in the boats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>There is much speculation as to our destination.
Is it the Mersey; the Clyde; Queenstown? Or
France direct? Where are we now, anyway? Each
noon, when the ship’s officers appear upon the
bridge in a body, and perform mysterious sun-worshipping
rites with sextants, the amateur experts
look knowing, and refer darkly to probable
latitudes and longitudes. One, diagnosing the present
commotion of billows as a “ground-swell,” announces
positively that we are just off the Bay of
Biscay. Another, basing his conclusions upon the
lengthening hours of daylight and the presence in
our wake of certain sea-birds (herring-gulls, really)
which he describes as “penguins,” announces confidently
that we are now well within the Arctic
Circle and will ultimately fetch a compass to
Aberdeen, <i lang="la">via</i> Iceland. The battle rages between
these two extremes: probably a carefully worked-out
average of opinion would bring us somewhere
near the truth. Gunners are quite familiar with the
process: they call it “bracketing.” But it does not
matter. The real fun will begin when we sight land,
and the authorities upon the subject start in to
identify it.</p>

<p>Another night has passed, and the question is
settled. We have sighted land, and are informed
that we may expect to make our port to-night. It is
a breathless summer morning, and our great ships,
which looked forlorn and insignificant amid the
ocean wastes, appear to have swelled a good deal
during the night. Certainly we form a stately pageant,
for our escorting forces have been augmented.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Destroyers are beating the bounds, nosey little
patrol-boats thread their way in and out of the
flotilla; silver-grey monsters float above our heads
in the blue, occasionally descending to dip a suspicious
nose towards the glittering wavelets. One
of them dives down gracefully to within hailing
distance of our own ship. It is a sublime moment.
A thousand Stetsons are waved in welcome, and
an earnest query—the spontaneous greeting of
Young America to Old England—is roared from
one of our portholes:</p>

<p>“Say, you got any <em>beer</em> up there?”</p>

<p>At the forward end of the boat-deck Boone
Cruttenden and Miss Lane were leaning over the
rail, in that confidential conjunction invariable in
all young couples, whether in war or peace, on the
last day of a voyage. Boone’s blue eyes surveyed
the scene around him, and glowed.</p>

<p>“It makes you think a bit!” he exclaimed.
“Here we are, thousands of us Americans, on
board British ships, being convoyed into a British
port by the British Navy. I wish the old Kaiser
was here! And I wish some of our folks at home
who are asking what the British Navy is doing in
this war could be here too! They might learn then
what is meant by the freedom of the seas!”</p>

<p>“Still,” complained the youthful seeker after
sensation, Miss Lane, “I did hope that we might
have seen just one little submarine.”</p>

<p>It is hard to refuse some people anything—especially
American girls of twenty-three. Miss
Lane’s wish was promptly gratified. A few hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
yards away, right in the middle of the convoy,
there was suddenly protruded from the unruffled
surface of the ocean a few feet of something grey,
slender, and perpendicular—something which,
after a hurried and perfunctory survey of the situation,
retired unobtrusively whence it came. But
not before it had been seen, and welcomed. For a
brief minute shells burst around it, machine guns
pattered imprecations over it, bombs descended
upon it from the heavens above, and depth-charges
detonated in the waters beneath. The convoy
altered its formation, as prudence dictated.
But nothing further happened. Calm reigned once
more upon the face of the waters.</p>

<p>“Some little surprise for him, I guess,” said
Cruttenden. “Lying on the bottom, and just came
up for a look around! He did not expect to poke his
periscope into this hornet’s nest, I should say. I
wonder if anything hit him. I guess not: he was too
slick. But you had your thrill right enough, Miss
Lane!”</p>

<p>Miss Lane sighed rapturously.</p>

<p>“The censor has just <em>got</em> to pass that when I
write home,” she announced.</p>

<p class="tb">Late that evening we made our port. On our way
in we passed a British cruiser, coaling. The band
was playing, as is usual during coaling. Our tall ship
slid past in the dusk, undemonstratively, almost
surreptitiously. One of the tragedies of modern
warfare lies in its anonymity. You may not display
your true colours or advertise your presence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
anywhere—even to your friends. So we crept past. But
a sailor can read ships as a landsman reads books.
The cruiser’s band stopped suddenly, right in the
middle of a tune, and in two minutes the cruiser’s
sides, rigging, and tops were crowded with half-naked,
coal-grimed humanity yelling themselves
hoarse to the roaring multitude on the liner.</p>

<p>“Listen!” shouted Boone Cruttenden into his
companion’s ear, as a fresh burst of sound added
itself to the tumult; “their band has struck up
again. Can you hear it?”</p>

<p>“No! Yes, I do now. I guess it’s ‘God Save the
King,’ or one of those tunes.”</p>

<p>But Miss Lane was wrong. Suddenly the cheering
died away for a moment, and the band made
itself heard, joyfully and triumphantly, for the
first time.</p>

<p>And the tune it played was “Over There.”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>gee!</em>” said Miss Lane, with a sob in her
voice. “Oh, gee!”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_FIVE">CHAPTER FIVE<br />
<span class="smaller">TERRA INCOGNITA</span></h2>

<p>We have not yet reached France, but we have discovered
England. It is a small island, and the visitor
must be prepared for a primitive civilization—for
instance, <cite>The Saturday Evening Post</cite> costs at
least fifteen cents—but it offers a fruitful and interesting
field for exploration.</p>

<p>Our debarkation was not attended by any
marked popular demonstration. Some of us were
inclined to resent the omission as savouring of insular
aloofness. But now we know the real reason.
<em>We are not supposed to be here.</em> We are a dead secret.
The port in which we disembarked has no
name. Its inhabitants are plunged into an official
trance. Therefore it would hardly be reasonable to
expect the insensible population of an anonymous
city to proffer a civic welcome to American soldiers
who are officially invisible anyway.</p>

<p>However, by a fortunate accident at the moment
of our arrival, a band of musicians happened
to be discoursing melody on the wharf, including
such airs as “The Star-Spangled Banner”
and “Dixie.” Moreover, a group of British Staff
Officers groped their way on board our imperceptible
vessel and greeted us cordially. They furthermore
presented to every man of us copies of a letter
written by King George with his own hand, bidding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
us welcome to his realm and expressing a wish
that it were possible for him to shake hands with
each one of us in person. Scores of copies of that letter
are now already on their way home to America—the
first souvenir of the War.</p>

<p>Thereafter we were packed into a child’s train,
drawn by a toy engine, and conveyed at a surprising
pace through a country of green fields, cut up
into checker-board squares by hedges and narrow
lanes, populated mainly by contemplative cows
and dotted with red-roofed farms and villages.</p>

<p>Occasionally we passed a camp. The tents were
toylike and tidy, like the country. They fitted the
landscape, just as a great four-square American
Army tent, with its wooden walls and dust-coloured
canvas top, fits in with a Texan horizon. In
these camps were men in khaki—some drilling,
some performing ablutions in buckets, some kicking
a football. Mr. Joe McCarthy’s passion for being
waved at was at length gratified.</p>

<p>Occasionally we stopped at the station of some
town. These were always crowded, as were the
trains. The strange little compartments in which
the English confine themselves when travelling
were packed with humanity—some of it standing
up and clinging to the luggage-rack—all of it encumbered
with much personal property in the shape
of bundles and babies. Evidently the War has cut
down transportation. At either end of these trains
a seething mob contended, with surprising good
temper, around a mountain of heavy baggage piled
upon the platform beside the express-van.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ain’t they got no Red Caps in this country?”
enquired Mr. McCarthy in disparaging tones.</p>

<p>“Their Red Caps are all wearing tin helmets
over in France,” replied the well-informed Al
Thompson. “Everybody here up to fifty is drafted.
Folks have to tote their own grips. I notice quite a
few women porters around. I guess their husbands
are in France, and these are holding down their
jobs for them.”</p>

<p>In which Al spoke no more than the truth.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in another part of the train, our
friend Jim Nichols, Major Powers, and one Bond,
a stout, comfortable representative of the Medical
Service, together with Boone Cruttenden—the
latter somewhat <i lang="fr">distrait</i>, for Miss Frances Lane
had been swept away with the other ninety-and-nine,
by a different train, to be no more seen—were
sharing a compartment with Captain Norton
and a British Staff Officer—a youthful Major.
The Major’s name was Floyd; he had materialized
during the chaos of debarkation. Norton had introduced
him to the American officers; stately salutes
had been exchanged; gentlemen had stated in
a constrained manner that they were pleased to
know one another; the whole party had crowded
into one compartment, and the train had started.</p>

<p>For nearly an hour almost total silence reigned.
Americans are sensitive folk, and Floyd’s melancholy
visage and paralyzing monocle fulfilled our
friends’ most pessimistic anticipations of the British
Staff Officer. After a few laboured commonplaces
the conversation lapsed altogether, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Americans devoted their attention to the flying
landscape.</p>

<p>Norton, a little uncomfortable, glanced occasionally
in the direction of his brother officer.
Major Floyd sat bolt upright in his seat, his gaze
focussed upon infinity. Norton, who was a man
of warm heart and quick temper, was conscious of
a vague feeling of resentment.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” he mused, “why an image like this
should have been sent as conducting officer. No
wonder Americans think us unsociable and rude.
And people over there were so good to us—”</p>

<p>At this moment Floyd removed his monocle and
addressed his right-hand neighbour—Boone Cruttenden.</p>

<p>“And now, Lieutenant, what are your impressions
of our country?”</p>

<p>Boone Cruttenden smiled. “You have not given
me much time to formulate any, Major,” he said,
glancing at his wrist-watch. “Just an hour!”</p>

<p>“That is fifty-nine minutes longer than the
<cite>World</cite> reporter gave me when I landed at West
Twenty-Third Street ten years ago,” replied Floyd.</p>

<p>“You know America?” Four homesick Americans
spoke simultaneously.</p>

<p>Floyd’s eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>“Some of it,” he said. “I was with the General
Electric Company at Schenectady for three years.
After that I worked on various electrical-engineering
jobs for about four years; I got as far west as
Cincinnati. I’m not a professional warrior, like
Norton there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>“Still, you have seen service in this War?” said
Major Powers.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I managed to get home from America
just in time for the start of things.”</p>

<p>“Have you served in France, or on one of your
other fronts?” asked Cruttenden. “The British
Army has such a large selection.”</p>

<p>“France all the time—<em>and</em> Belgium. Most of us
have taken a course of the Ypres Salient.”</p>

<p>“I guess those ribbons the Major is wearing
would give us details, if we could read them,” observed
Jim Nichols. “What do they stand for,
Major?”</p>

<p>Floyd laughed.</p>

<p>“As a traditional Englishman,” he said, “I suppose
I ought to hang my head confusedly and decline
to answer. But I have spent ten years outside
my own country, so I will tell you. This little fellow
with the rainbow effect you probably know: Norton
has it too. It means that we were both in Flanders
in Nineteen Fourteen. The khaki, red, and blue
is the Queen’s Medal for the South African War.
By the way, Major Powers, I notice that you have
the Spanish War ribbon. What is your other one—the
yellow and blue?”</p>

<p>“That relates to our Mexican Border troubles,”
replied Powers. “More discomfort than danger
getting that. What is that third ribbon of yours—the
red with the blue edges?”</p>

<p>“That? Oh, that is the D.S.O.”</p>

<p>“What does that stand for?” asked Boone.</p>

<p>“Well, before the War it was popularly supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
to stand for ‘Dam Silly Officer!’ Since then, however,
the military profession has risen in the eyes of
the world; so it now means ‘Done Something or
Other’!”</p>

<p>“And what did you get it for?” pursued the insatiable
Boone.</p>

<p>Floyd laughed.</p>

<p>“Counting jam-tins at the Base!” he said.</p>

<p>“I suppose it was while counting jam-tins you
lost your arm,” suggested the quiet voice of Major
Bond.</p>

<p>Floyd laughed again.</p>

<p>“You are too sharp for me, Doctor,” he said. “I
plead guilty. My left arm is an understudy. The
original is astray somewhere around Beaumont
Hamel. I have had to stay at home since then. But
now I want to get back to my first question, Lieutenant.
What are your impressions of this country—your
first impressions? I really do want to know.
I have been aching to ask you for the last hour, but
I felt that I had to play up a little first. Monocle—vacant
stare, and all that! The traditional Englishman,
in fact. I felt you were entitled to meet one,”
continued this eccentric man; “and I took especial
pains to give you a good impersonation, because
you may experience some difficulty in finding another.
The fact is, the traditional Englishman is
getting rare. We have all been shaken out of ourselves
these days. After the War he may come back—perhaps.
Perhaps not.” He sighed gently. “But
at present I am here to supply you with information
about the customs and institutions of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
country. I am detailed for the job. I am paid for
it. Please ask me questions, somebody?”</p>

<p>No one could resist this solemn appeal. First one
query was proffered, then another. Presently the
American passion for getting to the root of the
matter was in full play.</p>

<p>“Why did the English travel in closed boxes?
Why were the locomotives so small, and why did
they burn soft coal? Why were there so many overhead
bridges when a grade-crossing would suffice?
What would be the wages of that old man working
in that field? What was that bright yellow crop
growing in that section? Why did vehicles in a
street keep to the left? Was there any organized
system of irrigation, that the country was all so
green? Was there game in those woods, and who
had the right to hunt it?”</p>

<p>Norton, a professional soldier from his school
days, knew nothing of many of these things. He
was also a typical Englishman, and had been
brought up to accept matters as he found them.
But he was the son of an English country squire,
and he was able to name the various crops—meadow-grass,
hay-grass, wheat, oats, barley, potatoes,
beans—whose variegated colours impart to
an English landscape its curious crazy-quilt effect.
He was well-versed, too, in agricultural economics
and the hoary traditions of the feudal system, and
discussed voluminously, as an Englishman will
when started upon his own subject, upon farm-labourers’
wages, the rotation of crops, and the
Ground Game Act.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Floyd, who agreed with Dr. Samuel Johnson in
regarding one green field as very like another green
field, recked nothing of these things. But he was a
mine of information on railroad management. To a
deeply interested audience he traced the origin of
the standard railway gauge of the world back to an
obscure English colliery road of George Stephenson’s
days: he ascribed the multitude of overhead
bridges and tightly locked level crossings to the
benevolent fussiness of the Board of Trade. He
even knew—to the frank amazement of Captain
Norton—the maximum height from rail-level to
which a British locomotive, by reason of the aforesaid
bridges, can aspire—thus accounting for the
stunted appearance of the same by comparison
with its American brother, which in an atmosphere
of greater freedom is permitted to soar some nine
feet higher. Greatly daring, he even justified the
British custom of keeping to the left, on the ground
that it dated back to the days when men rode on
horseback, and riders and postilions, to mount or
dismount, must perforce draw in to the near side of
the road.</p>

<p>An American is forever battling between two
instincts—native appreciation of what is modern
and efficient, and inherited veneration for what is
ancient and inconvenient. Common sense usually
compels him to favour the former; but he is never
so happy as when he can conserve or justify the
latter.</p>

<p>Major Floyd gratified this instinct. He carried
his hearers back to the days of stage-coaches. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
told of the opening of the Stockton and Darlington
Railway; of Brunel and the Broad Gauge; of the
railway races in the nineties, when the Scottish Express
ran four hundred miles in seven hours. Altogether,
in his able hands, “Romance brought up
the Nine Fifteen.”</p>

<p>The locomotive gave a shriek, and the train began
to slow down. Major Powers turned from the
contemplation of a tiny English town nestling in a
shallow valley a mile away. With its red roofs and
square church tower set against a background of
living green, it looked the embodiment of uneventful
drowsiness. Certainly a little imagination was
required to realize that under nearly every one of
these same roofs there stood at least one empty
chair—a chair that might or might not be occupied
again—and that beneath that ancient tower
for four long years, week by week, in good times
and in bad, women, children, and old men had congregated
to pray that those whose names were inscribed
upon the illuminated scroll in the church
porch—squire’s son, parson’s son, farmer’s son,
poacher’s son—might in God’s good time come
home again, having achieved the purpose for
which they had set out.</p>

<p>Powers possessed the requisite imagination. He
had been reared in Kentucky—that land of fair
women and noble horses. This toy town, which
could have been transported bodily into his native
State without materially affecting either the landscape
or the census, appealed to him, as small children
appeal to large people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>He turned to Norton, and said simply:</p>

<p>“Captain, I have never been outside of America
before. I have been looking over this little island of
yours, and I want to tell you, right now, that I
think it is worth fighting for!”</p>

<p>“Thanks awfully,” said Norton gravely, and
offered an unexpected hand.</p>

<span class="smaller">SOCIAL CUSTOMS OF THE ISLANDERS</span></h2>

<p>We are now at a rest-camp, recharging our batteries
after the fatigues of sea travel before proceeding
to the conquest of Germany.</p>

<p>The camp is situated deep in rural England. At
our feet, in a valley, lies an ancient city, dominated
by a mighty cathedral. It was once a walled city,
but only the gates remain now—King’s Gate and
West Gate. At the top of the High Street stands a
great rough-hewn statue of Alfred the Great—dead
for more than a thousand years. He makes a
fine figure, with his coat of mail and uplifted broadsword.
Mr. Eddie Gillette, among whose sterling
virtues sentiment finds no place, compares him,
not unfavourably, with a New York traffic cop.
Mr. Joe McCarthy, still dyspeptic from the effects
of prolonged ocean travel, describes the deceased
monarch as a tough guy, and adds further that in
his opinion this is a dead town. Al Thompson, of
finer clay, inspects the statue approvingly, then
passes on with a handful of interested spectators
to the cathedral, whose grey walls keep eternal
vigil over the dust of Saxon, Norman, and English
dead—much of it ancestral American dust.</p>

<p>Elderly gentlemen in maroon dressing-gowns
conduct the party round, and in piping tones introduce
the New World to the Old. But not all
Old. In one nook of the great fabric, guarded by
Old Glory itself, gleaming brightly in the twilight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
stands an Innovation—a temporary shrine dedicated
to fallen American soldiers, particularly
those who have died in English hospitals from
wounds received in France. After the War the memorial
is to take the form of a permanent stained-glass
window. At present in England people are
not manufacturing stained-glass windows—only
earning them.</p>

<p>The countryside is full of camps—typically
English—not spacious and bewildering such as
those which scared the mountaineer from Tennessee,
but prim and tidy, like an English kitchen-garden.
The white conical tents are set out in close,
level rows, like cabbages. The Headquarters tent
and the Officers’ Mess are fenced in by a ring of
curious boundary-stones, set a few feet apart and
carefully whitewashed. The district is full of English
soldiers. We have never seen them before, and
we regard them with interest. We note with gratification
that they are in the main smaller than ourselves
and not so well set-up, though sturdy enough.
Their teeth appear to require attention: gold teeth
have not yet reached this country. They wear
ragged mustaches, and smoke eternal cigarettes.
The language that they speak is entirely incomprehensible.</p>

<p>Their officers, on the other hand, present a decidedly
gay and frivolous appearance. They look
very young; they wear their caps at a rakish angle;
they carry canes. They are secretly regarded by
many of us as verging upon the Clarence class. But
the old stagers of our camp warn us not to form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
our judgments too hastily. When we are able to
read the biography which every British soldier
carries upon his sleeve or breast—scraps of ribbon,
service chevrons, wound stripes, and the like—we
will realize that things, especially in England,
are not always what they seem.</p>

<p>In fact, we have begun to realize this already.
They are not communicative, the people we meet
here. They talk little of the War, except possibly
to belittle their own conduct thereof or disparage
their own leaders; but we are dimly conscious that
England is not making a display of company manners
at present. Her luxurious private parks are
scarred by horse-lines; her golf-courses are growing
potatoes. Her great country-houses, badly in
need of paint and plaster, are flying Red Cross
flags, and convalescent soldiers in hospital blue
lounge upon balustraded terraces where peacocks
were wont to strut. Her automobiles appear to
have enlisted in the Army: they wear a businesslike
uniform of grey paint, and are driven by attractive
young women in khaki. Every one appears
to wear a uniform of some kind—certainly
no one wears mourning—and all seem too busy to
worry about ceremony.</p>

<p>When we arrived in this town, after our long
cross-country journey from our landing port, we
were conscious of a pleasant feeling of anticipation.
We thought of the folk who had seen us off at home—cramming
the railway stations, cheering, waving,
weeping—and though we naturally did not
expect such a demonstration, we did expect something.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Well, it did not turn out that way. We arrived
almost furtively, in the dead of night, in a
station where one gas-lamp in six was burning. We
were warned to fall in quietly, and to refrain from
noise as we marched through the town.</p>

<p>“Not a very overwhelming display of cordiality,
I’m afraid,” said Major Floyd; “but we are up
against official secrets again. A lady called Dora:<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
you will become well acquainted with her. It is not
officially known to any one—except the Boche, of
course—that this is an American Rest Depot, so
we are concealing the fact from the inhabitants.
The streets are a bit dark, I’m afraid; but we are
precious short of coal—supplying France and
Italy as well as ourselves—and that hits our lighting
arrangements rather hard. Besides, we have
the Gothas to think of. Are your men ready to
move off, Colonel? Very good: I’ll lead the way.
You will notice our solitary attempt at the glad-hand
business just outside the station.”</p>

<p>The “solitary attempt” proved to be a discreetly
illuminated notice spanning the street on
the <i lang="fr">façade</i> of an arch. It said: <span class="smcapuc">WELCOME, AMERICA!</span></p>

<p>As an emotional outburst the greeting was perhaps
open to criticism on the score of reticence;
but to some of us, who knew our stiff, angular, inarticulate
England better than others, there was
something rather moving about the whole idea.</p>

<p>We tramped under the sign. Those who had the
fancy to turn and look up at the other face of the
arch found another notice: <span class="smcapuc">GOD-SPEED!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></span></p>

<p>“‘God-speed’! That’s a bit sudden,” observed a
young machine-gunner to a grizzled English sergeant
who was acting as assistant shepherd.
“We’ve hardly arrived yet.”</p>

<p>“That ain’t meant for you, my lad,” replied the
veteran. “You ain’t supposed to read that—yet.
That’s for another lot of your boys what are starting
off to-night for France. You’ll likely meet ’em
coming down the ’ill as you goes up.”</p>

<p>We did. And when the event took place—when
the two bands of tramping American exiles
brushed hands for a moment in the soft summer
darkness of a strange land—I fear there was some
transgression of official regulations on the subject
of silent and secret night marching. But, after all,
there are limits to human virtue.</p>

<p>Yes, everybody here appears decidedly busy—especially
the women. That shrewd observer of
humanity, Al Thompson, does not fail to remark
upon the fact in a letter to his wife:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>You get kind of used here to see a woman do all the chores
that we all considered a man’s job. Driving automobiles, or
cleaning windows high up in the air, or delivering mails, or
tending a street-car, or despatching trains. They have boys,
quite little fellers, to help them with the trains. The woman
does the work and the boy blows a whistle, like what you
would expect of a boy. I seen a whole bunch of girls one day
outside a factory, with their faces and hands stained yellow.
That was picric acid: they make shells with it. It spoils
their looks some, but they should worry. They just waved
their hands and laughed at us when we tried to josh them.
I reckon the girls at home are all doing that too now; but
don’t you go for to stain yourself yellow, my dear.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>But the Islanders are not too busy to make an
attempt to entertain us. Some of these attempts
are rather formidable. To boys like Second Lieutenant
Sam Richards and his crony Jim Hollis, in
whose pleasant little home town far west of the
Alleghenies every one knows every one else, and
young men and maidens usually exchange invitations
over the telephone (which instrument is
practically unknown in English rural districts),
and that awful shibboleth of English society, the
language of the third person, is happily extinct, it
is a little alarming to find upon the bulletin-board
in the Mess a stiff square of white pasteboard bearing
the legend:</p>

<div class="bbox">

<p class="center"><i>Col. Adams and Officers</i></p>

<p class="center">LADY WYVERN-GRYPHON</p>

<p class="center">AT HOME</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">SATURDAY, JULY 6th</span>, 3:30 P.M.-7:00</p>

<p class="center">AT<br />
BROADOAK PARK</p>

<p class="center">LAWN TENNIS <span class="spacer">&nbsp;</span> R.S.V.P.</p>

</div>

<p>Jim Hollis scrutinized this document whimsically.
Then he turned to his companion.</p>

<p>“We must get this right,” he said. “Who is
Lady Wy-Wy—?”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Sam. “Call her Lady Whiskey-Syphon—I
bet the name isn’t pronounced
the way it’s spelled, anyway.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” continued Jim, “who <em>is</em> Lady Whiskey-Syphon,
and what does this ‘ad.’ mean?”</p>

<p>“It means,” replied Sam, whose sense of humour
was always stimulated by the contemplation of
British National institutions, “that this Lady has
been away and now she’s back home.”</p>

<p>“For three and a half hours?”</p>

<p>“Yes. These people have a bunch of homes, like
our millionaires. They own real-estate lots all over
the country, and it stands to reason they have a
home in each.”</p>

<p>“And why does she put ‘Lawn Tennis’ down
there in that corner?”</p>

<p>“Because she’s going to <em>play</em> lawn tennis, from
three-thirty to seven. That’s easy.”</p>

<p>“But what does she want to tell us for? We are
nothing in her young life.”</p>

<p>“She wants us to go play with her,” explained
Sam gently. “Nobody can play lawn tennis by
themselves. She wants <em>you</em>, boy.”</p>

<p>“Where does it say that?” enquired the incredulous
James.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t say it. The English don’t say it.
It would sound too eager. They just mention
the event casually, and if you want to go you
can.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t want to go.”</p>

<p>“Well, write and say so.”</p>

<p>“Why? It doesn’t tell me to do that on the
card.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t it? Jim Hollis, haven’t you got any
sisters to tell you what things mean? Look at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
R.S.V.P. down there! That’s the reference-number
of the file, and you quote it in replying.”</p>

<p>Jim paled.</p>

<p>“Listen, how do you address anybody like
that?” he enquired, despairingly.</p>

<p>Sam’s eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>“Ask the Adjutant,” he advised.</p>

<p>Reference to that overworked official elicited
the information that the invitation had already
been accepted by the Colonel on behalf of the
Mess, and that if the regiment were still in England
on July the sixth two or three officers would
be detailed to accompany him to Broadoak Park.</p>

<p>“Me for the backwoods on the sixth!” murmured
Master Hollis fervently.</p>

<p>But the very next day, as Jim and Sam were
toiling up the hill to the camp after inspecting the
cathedral, they were overtaken by an elderly automobile.
It drew up beside them, and a rather gruff
voice enquired:</p>

<p>“Won’t you get in and let me drive you up to
the camp? I am going that way, anyhow.”</p>

<p>They accepted gratefully—it was a blazing hot
day—and presently found themselves chatting
composedly, with the American’s natural instinct
for easy conversation, with a high-nosed, deep-voiced
old lady in black.</p>

<p>“One ought to be thankful to be able to drive
anywhere these days,” remarked their hostess—“let
alone give any one a lift. Do you know how
much petrol the Controller allows me? Ten gallons
a month! And I live five miles from a railway station!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
It used to be six gallons, but I get a little
more now because I am taking in more patients.
My house is a hospital, you know.”</p>

<p>They did not know; but it did not seem to matter,
for the old lady continued:</p>

<p>“I hope you are coming to my tennis-party on
the sixth. You will meet some charming girls—mostly
V.A.D.’s. You got a card, I suppose?”</p>

<p>Jim, shrinking back into the cushions, pressed
uneasily upon the toe of his brother officer. But
Lady Wyvern-Gryphon swept on:</p>

<p>“I realized afterwards how stupid I had been to
send out the cards at all. It would have been much
simpler and more considerate to do what I am doing
now—pay an informal call on your Colonel
and ask him to bring along any officers who might
have nothing better to do on the day, instead of
bothering busy men to answer silly written invitations.
But one can never do a thing except in the
way one has done it for forty years—even with a
War on. You must have thought me very tiresome.”
(She pronounced it “tarsome.”) “What
quaint experiences you must be having among
us!”</p>

<p>“We are having very pleasant experiences,”
said Jim.</p>

<p>“That’s nice of you. You said it much more
promptly than an Englishman would have done,
too. Do you know,” continued this most informal
<i lang="fr">grande dame</i>, rounding suddenly upon the speaker,
“that when you smile you are amazingly like my
second son?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>“He is in France, I suppose?” hazarded Jim.</p>

<p>“Yes—he is in France. And—he is not coming
back to me, I fear.” The old lady’s voice was as
gruff as ever. “It happened at Le Cateau, nearly
four years ago. He was mentioned in Despatches,
though. One will always feel glad of that.”</p>

<p>“And proud,” added Sam Richards.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes—proud too. Pride is the greatest
boon bestowed on mothers in war-time. I don’t
know why the clergy are always preaching against
it. Before this War I possessed four sons, and a certain
modicum of pride. Now I have only one son,
but I have four times as much pride. One finds it
very sustaining. Have you boys mothers?”</p>

<p>Both boys nodded assent.</p>

<p>“Well, if you will give me their addresses I
will write to them both, and say I have seen
you. Mothers like first-hand information, you
know.”</p>

<p>Visiting-cards were produced shyly, and disappeared
into a little black bag.</p>

<p>“I have never been in America,” continued
Lady Wyvern-Gryphon. “But one of my daughters-in-law
is American. She came from Philadelphia.
Is that anywhere near your homes? You
know it, at any rate.”</p>

<p>They confessed that they lived some fifteen
hundred miles from Philadelphia.</p>

<p>“Indeed!” remarked her ladyship, not at all
perturbed. “That is interesting. We have no conception
of distance in this country. Now tell me,
how does an American country town differ from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
town like this? What does a street look like, compared
with one of ours?”</p>

<p>“Wider, and straighter,” said Jim.</p>

<p>“With maple trees growing along,” added Sam.</p>

<p>“The houses are wooden,” continued Jim,
warming up—“painted white, with a piazza, and
wire doors to keep the flies out in—”</p>

<p>“And no fences between the houses,” continued
Sam, almost shouting. “And none in front. You
just step right down on the street.”</p>

<p>“And in summer-time,” interrupted Jim, with
eyes closed rapturously, “when the sun strikes
down through the maple trees, an’—oh, <em>gee</em>, I
wish I was there now!”</p>

<p>After that our two lieutenants took entire
charge of the conversation. They conducted Lady
Wyvern-Gryphon, street by street, block by block,
through their home town. They described the railroad
station, where the great trunk track runs
through and the mail trains pause for brief refreshment
on their long journey to the Pacific Coast.
They described the Pullman cars; the porters with
their white jackets and black faces; they related,
with affectionate relish, one or two standard anecdotes
aimed at that common target of American
sarcasm, the upper berth. They described the
street-car system, and explained carefully that to
get from Sam’s house to Jim’s you had to change
cars at the corner of M Street and Twenty-first—</p>

<p>“There’s a drug-store on the corner,” mentioned
Jim. (Whether as a topographical pointer or in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
wistful reference to far-distant ice-cream soda, is
not known.)</p>

<p>They passed on to the million-dollar Insurance
Building downtown; the State University on the
hill above; the Country Club, with its summer
games and winter dances. Finally, being American
and not English, they spoke frankly, naturally,
and appreciatively of their womenkind. Altogether,
being but boys, and homesick boys at
that, they spoke all that was in their hearts, and
incidentally conveyed considerable warmth to the
heart of a rather formidable, extremely lonely, old
lady.</p>

<p>They saluted politely when the time came to
part, and informed their new friend that they were
very pleased to have known her.</p>

<p>“And I am very pleased to have known <em>you!</em>”
replied her ladyship, with a heartiness which would
have surprised some of her friends. “Don’t bother
about that tennis invitation. You probably won’t
be here, anyway, to judge from the speed with
which you all scuttle through this country. Come
to lunch to-morrow instead, and tell me more.”</p>

<p>They went.</p>

<span class="smaller">THREE MUSKETEERS IN LONDON</span></h2>

<p>Our stay in England has been prolonged beyond
the usual time, chiefly because that impartial foe of
the just and the unjust, the Spanish Influenza, has
opened a campaign against us, and it is manifestly
foolish to attack Germany before you have settled
accounts with Spain.</p>

<p>Pending the time when our invalids shall be
convalescent, we have had some interesting experiences.
We have explored the countryside,
and studied and analyzed the structure of insular
society. We have consorted with Barons, Squires,
and Knights of the Shire; with Bishops, Priests,
and Deacons; with Waacs, Wrens, and V.A.D.’s;
with Farmers, Hedgers, and Land Girls; with
Mayors and Corporations. They are all interesting;
most of them are quite human; and all, once
you know them, are extremely friendly and anxious
to entertain us.</p>

<p>For instance, there was the Fourth of July, officially
celebrated in London. British Official—not
American. The Americans are a patriotic people;
but it certainly had not occurred to us, sojourning
in Great Britain, to undertake, this year of all
years, any ostentatious celebration of the foundation
of our national liberties.</p>

<p>But John Bull would have none of this false delicacy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>“My dear fellow,” he said in effect, “of <em>course</em>
you must celebrate the Fourth of July. We know it
is one of your greatest national festivals. We will
help you. We will put up flags, arrange a demonstration,
and devise special features for the day.
Let me see—you usually have fireworks, don’t
you? Sorry! I’m afraid we can’t quite manage fireworks
this year. You see, they might be misconstrued
into an air-raid warning. But anything else—bands,
processions, baseball? My boy, you shall
have them all! What else? Won’t you require
pumpkin-pie, or cranberry sauce, or something of
that kind? Oh—that’s <em>Thanksgiving</em>? I beg your
pardon. Stupid of me to mix ’em. Anyway, you
must have a jolly good time. We should never forgive
ourselves if we didn’t give you a chance to
celebrate an occasion like that. I know how <em>we</em>
should feel if we had to cut out Christmas, old
man!”</p>

<p>We forbore to explain that Christmas is also, to a
certain extent, a recognized festival in the United
States, and merely accepted John Bull’s invitation
in the spirit in which it was offered—that is to
say, with great heartiness but some vagueness as
to the probable course of events.</p>

<p>However, everything worked out right on the
day. On the Fourth of July, nineteen eighteen,
London was turned over to the Americans. In the
morning, parties of American soldiers and sailors
proceeded to explore the town. They enquired politely
of passers-by for the Tower of London; the
Old Curiosity Shop; the Houses of Parliament,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Westminster Abbey; Buckingham Palace. The
passers-by, though cordially disposed, did not always
know where these places were. The Londoner
takes his national monuments, like the British
Constitution and the British Navy, for granted,
and is seldom concerned with the Why and Wherefore
thereof. However, we succeeded in discovering
most of these places for ourselves, and were
gratified to observe that Old Glory was amicably
sharing a flagpole over the Palace of Westminster
with the Union Jack.</p>

<p>By high noon most of us had squeezed ourselves
into Central Hall, Westminster, where all the
Americans in London seemed to be gathered, together
with a goodly percentage of the native element.
A solid wedge of convalescent soldiers in
hospital blue supplied the necessary reminder of
the Thing which had brought us together. The
speakers included a British ex-Ambassador, venerated
on both sides of the Atlantic, a British Cabinet
Minister, an American Admiral, and an American
General. Altogether, an affair to write home
about.</p>

<p>Thereafter, refreshment, at the Eagle Hut, the
Beaver Hut, Washington Inn, and other recently
opened hospitality centres. At one of these Ikey
Zingbaum succeeded during the rush of business
in cashing a Confederate twenty-dollar bill, which
had been “wished on” him one dark night some
years previously, and which he had carried in his
pocket, faint yet pursuing, ever since. He got four
pounds sterling for it—a rate of interest more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
indicative of International amity than financial
condition.</p>

<p>Al Thompson, Ed Gillette, and that captious
critic Joe McCarthy (not yet entirely recovered
from dyspepsia incurred upon his maiden ocean
voyage), pushed their way out of the crowded Hall
into the blazing July sunshine, and enquired of one
another simultaneously:</p>

<p>“Where do we eat?”</p>

<p>In a spirit of appropriate independence they
decided to elude the special arrangements made
for their entertainment and forage for themselves.
From the moment of their embarkation from their
native land their daily diet had been selected and
provided by a paternal but unimaginative Department
of State, and their stomachs cried out for
something unusual, unexpected, and, if possible,
unwholesome. But London has an area of seven
hundred and fifty square miles. This offers an embarrassing
choice of places of refreshment. They
swung on their heels undecided.</p>

<p>“I guess we better ask some guy,” suggested Ed
Gillette.</p>

<p>The motion was seconded by Al Thompson.</p>

<p>“There’s a Jock,” he said. “Let’s go ask him.”</p>

<p>They approached their quarry—a squat figure
in a kilt, with a round and overheated countenance
beaming like a vermilion haggis under a voluminous
khaki bonnet—and addressing him as
“friend,” enquired:</p>

<p>“Where do folks eat around here?”</p>

<p>The Scot smiled affably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m no varra weel acquent with this toon,” he
admitted. “If it was Airdrie, now, or Coatbridge!
I’m awa’ there to-night. I’m just on leave, like
yourselves. But I doot we’ll no be goin’ far wrong
if we keep along toward The Strand. Will I come
with you?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” replied Ed Gillette heartily.</p>

<p>“This is on us,” Al Thompson hastened to add.</p>

<p>The Scotsman led the way. Whether he had
grasped the implied offer of hospitality is doubtful.
However, that hardened cynic Joe McCarthy
cherished no illusions on the subject. He sniffed
contemptuously.</p>

<p>Their walk towards The Strand—it is to be
feared that their guide’s sense of direction was
once or twice at fault—gave them further opportunities
of studying the habits and customs of the
strange race upon whom they had descended. In
one quiet street—there are many such in London
these days, for traffic is down to a minimum—they
beheld a middle-aged lady hail a crawling
taxi-cab. The driver of the vehicle took not the
slightest notice, but slid upon his way.</p>

<p>“There’s jest twa-three o’ they taxis nowadays
where formerly there was a hunnerd in a street,”
explained that man-about-town, Private Andrew
Drummond. “Consequently, they can pick and
choose. They’ll no tak’ a body that looks ower
carefu’ of their money. There’s another yin!
He’ll give the auld wife the go-bye too, I’m thinking.
She doesna look like yin o’ the extravagant
soort.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>He was right. A second taxi sauntered past the
gesticulating lady. This time the driver, after a
single fleeting glance, condescended to flip his
right hand in the air, in a gesture which may have
been intended to indicate that he had particular
business elsewhere, but more probably expressed
his contempt for the pedestrian world in general.</p>

<p>The gesture was observed by a passing citizen—an
elderly gentleman with white whiskers and
spats—who, at first appropriating it to himself,
stopped and glared at the offender. Then noting
beauty in distress upon the sidewalk, he assailed
the taxi with indignant cries.</p>

<p>“Hi, there! Taxi! Stop! Stop, there! Don’t you
see the lady hailing you?”</p>

<p>The taxi-driver perfectly impassive, pressed his
accelerator.</p>

<p>“Stop, confound you!” yelled the old gentleman,
waving his umbrella. “Stop, you blackguard!
Don’t you hear—”</p>

<p>This time the taxi-driver replied with a gesture
quite unmistakable, and disappeared from sight
round the corner.</p>

<p>The old gentleman turned apologetically to his
Ariadne.</p>

<p>“Intolerable! Monstrous!” he announced. “If
you will allow me, madam, I will stay and secure
the next taxi for you, or give the man in charge.”</p>

<p>“Boys,” murmured the dreamy voice of that
bonny fighter, Ed Gillette, “I guess we’ll stay an’
see this through. We’re nootral, of course, but
maybe we can hand the taxi-driver a Note!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Without further pressure our four friends anchored
in a favourable position on the opposite
side of the sunny street, and awaited developments.
One or two vehicles sped through, but they were
either military automobiles or taxis carrying
passengers. Once or twice a tradesman’s delivery-van
passed by, rendered top-heavy in appearance
by a bloated gas-bag billowing upon the roof. But
nothing else.</p>

<p>“’Nother dead town!” murmured Joe McCarthy,
not without satisfaction.</p>

<p>As he spoke, another taxi, with flag up, swung
round the corner. The old gentleman, taking up a
frontal position in the middle of the street, waved
his umbrella. The taxi, with a swerve that would
have done credit to a destroyer avoiding a mine,
eluded him, and resumed its normal course. This
manœuvre accomplished, it slackened speed again.</p>

<p>But the British are a tenacious race. The elderly
champion of the fair turned and ran with surprising
swiftness after the receding vehicle. He overtook
it. He took a flying leap upon the footboard beside
the driver, and grasping that astonished malefactor
by the collar with one hand laid hold of the side
brake with the other. Employing the driver’s
neck as fulcrum, he pulled the lever with all his
strength and jammed the brakes on hard. His
baffled victim having automatically thrown open
the throttle of the engine, the whirring back
wheels, caught in the full embrace of the brake,
skidded violently; the cab described a semicircle,
and ran to a full stop on the sidewalk with its radiator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
(which had narrowly missed Joe McCarthy)
pressed affectionately against some one’s area
railings.</p>

<p>After this all concerned got into action with
as little delay as possible. The old gentleman,
descending from his perch, opened upon his
opponent at a range of about three feet. Such
phrases as “Ruffian!” “Bandit!” “Thug!” “Yahoo!”
“Police!” “War on, too!” flew from him
like hail. The driver, though obviously rattled by
the complete unexpectedness of the attack, and
further hampered by having swallowed the glowing
stub of a cigarette, reacted (as they say in the
official <i lang="fr">communiqué</i>) with creditable promptness.</p>

<p>“Call yourself a gentleman?” he coughed. “’Ard-workin’
man like me!… Over milingtary age!…
Carryin’ on as well as I can till the boys comes
’ome!… Disgrace, that’s what you are!… Got
a job in the War Office, I’ll lay a tanner!… I’ll
summons you for assault and damagin’ my keb!…
The first copper I sees…”</p>

<p>And so on. Meanwhile the lady in the case,
much to her own surprise, found herself propelled
by four pairs of willing hands into the cab. This
done, the door was shut upon her, and a soothing
Scots-American chorus assured her through the
window-glass that the entire matter would straightway
be adjusted. (“Fixed” was the exact term
employed.)</p>

<p>But now a new figure added itself to the tableau—a
slightly nervous individual in blue, with
silver buttons and flat peaked cap. He coughed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
in a deprecating fashion, and produced a notebook.</p>

<p>“That a cop?” enquired Ed Gillette of the
Scot.</p>

<p>“No jist exactly. He’s a ‘Special.’ I doot he’ll
no be a match for the taxi-man.”</p>

<p>But the Special Constable, though his lack of
stolidity betrayed the amateur, had been well-drilled
in his part.</p>

<p>“Now, then, now, then,” he demanded sternly,
“what’s all this? Driver, what is your cab doing
up against these railings? You are causing an
obstruction.”</p>

<p>These questions were promptly answered by
the old gentleman in a sustained passage, supported
by a soprano <i lang="it">obbligato</i> from the interior of
the taxi. The “Special” listened judicially, and
finally held up his hand.</p>

<p>“That’ll do,” he intimated, and turned to the
taxi-driver.</p>

<p>“What have you got to say?”</p>

<p>The taxi-driver, having by this time cleared his
larynx of cigarette-ash, shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Me? Oh, nothink! What I say don’t matter.
I’m a poor man: I don’t count for anythink. That
old garrotter only tried to murder me—that’s
all! Flew at me, he did, out of the middle of the
road like a laughin’ hyena, and nearly broke my
neck, besides wreckin’ my keb. But of course I
don’t matter. Let ’im ’ave it ’is own way. One law
for the rich, and another—”</p>

<p>“Do you charge this gentleman with assault?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
interpolated the Special, who had evidently come
to the conclusion that it was time to get down
to the rigid official formula provided for such
occasions as this.</p>

<p>“Charge ’im? And waste ’alf a workin’ day at
a blinkin’ police court, waitin’ for the case to come
on? Not me!” replied the taxi-man, with evident
sincerity. “Oh, no, I’m only a pore—”</p>

<p>“Constable, will you <em>please</em> tell this man to drive
me to Half-moon Street?” demanded a high-pitched
voice from the interior of the cab.</p>

<p>“I have no power to compel him to drive you
anywhere, madam,” replied the Special, with
majestic humility.</p>

<p>“Well, what powers <em>have</em> you got?” shouted the
old gentleman.</p>

<p>“At your request, sir, I can take his name and
number, and you can charge him with declining
to ply for hire when called upon to do so,” chanted
the limb of the Law. “Do you wish to charge
him?”</p>

<p>“<em>Wish?</em>” shrieked the old gentleman. “Of
course I wish! I mean”—as he met the cold and
steady eye of the Special—“I shall be obliged if
you will charge this man, officer.”</p>

<p>“Very good,” was the gracious reply. “Now
I can <em>act</em>.” The Special turned to the cabman, with
pencil poised. “Your name?”</p>

<p>“Most certainly you shell ’ave my name!”
retorted the other, with the air of a master-tactician
who at last sees his opponent walk into
a long-prepared trap. “<em>And</em> my number, too!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
And you’ll oblige me, Constable, by takin’ <em>his</em>
name and address as well. I don’t intend for to—”</p>

<p>“Your name?” suggested the Special unfeelingly.</p>

<p>“Henery Mosscockle, Number Five-oh-seven-oh—”</p>

<p>Details followed, all duly noted. Then came
the turn of the old gentleman. He proffered a
visiting-card, and gave another to the cabman,
who apologized for being unable to reciprocate,
on the ground that he had left his card-case
on the Victrola in his drawing-room. Our Three
Musketeers, together with their D’Artagnan,
were moved to audible chuckles. The old gentleman,
aware of their presence for the first time,
swung round and addressed them.</p>

<p>“American soldiers!” he exclaimed. “Good-morning,
gentlemen. I am sorry that you should
have witnessed such a poor specimen of British
patriotism. None of that sort in your country,
I’ll be bound!”</p>

<p>Our friends saluted politely, and cast about for
an answer which should be both candid and equally
agreeable to all parties—not, when you come to
think of it, a particularly easy task. But it was
that ill-used individual, the taxi-driver, who
replied. He thrust a bristling chin towards the
old gentleman.</p>

<p>“Patriotism?” he barked. “As man to man, tell
me—’ow old are you?”</p>

<p>“That,” snapped the old gentleman, “is my
business!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” announced the taxi-driver, with the
air of a man who has been awarded a walk-over,
“I’m fifty-seven. Any sons?”</p>

<p>“Two.”</p>

<p>“Two? Well, I got two too—one in the East
Surreys and the other in the Tanks. (’E was a
machine-gunner in the first place.) Both bin in
the War four years. Both bin wounded. What are
yours in? The Circumloosion Office, or the Conchies’
Battalion?”<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>“One is in the Coldstream Guards. The other
was a Gunner, but he was killed.”</p>

<p>The cabman became human at once.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for that—sir! May I ask where?”</p>

<p>“First Battle of Ypres.”</p>

<p>“Epray? That was where our Bert stopped his
first one.”</p>

<p>“I have a son too,” interpolated the Special
eagerly—“in the—”</p>

<p>But no one took any notice of him. The cabman
and the old gentleman had entirely forgotten
the existence of the rest of the party.</p>

<p>“Not badly wounded, I hope?”</p>

<p>“Nothing to signify—a couple of machine-gun
bullets in the forearm. The second time was
worser. That was at a place somewhere in the
’Indenburg line, spring of last year. ’En-in-’Ell,
or some such name. Bert copped a sweet one that
time—bit o’ shell-splinter as big as me ’and. It
was nearly a year before ’e was fit to go back.
You see—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>But the old gentleman had laid an indignant
hand on the other father’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“You mean to tell me,” he demanded, “that
your son, twice badly wounded, has been sent
back to the firing-line again?”</p>

<p>“I do. He’s there now.”</p>

<p>For the second time that day the old gentleman
began to shake his fist.</p>

<p>“It’s monstrous!” he shouted. “It’s damnable!
They did the same thing to my boy—my only
surviving boy! It’s this infernal system of throwing
all the burden on the willing horse—this
miserable cringing to so-called Labour!” He
choked. “The Government.… If I were Lloyd
George.…” He exploded. “<em>Pah!</em>”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said a soothing voice from the
interior of the cab. “If he won’t go, he won’t.
Besides, it’s no use making him violent. I dare
say I shall be able to get another taxi. Will you
please open this door, Constable? It seems to
have stuck.”</p>

<p>The two parents stopped short, guiltily conscious
of having strayed from their text. Al
Thompson addressed the driver.</p>

<p>“Say, friend,” he enquired, “ain’t you got
enough gas to take this lady where she belongs?”</p>

<p>“Gas?” The taxi-driver glared suspiciously.</p>

<p>“He means petrol,” interpreted the Special.</p>

<p>“I got about an inch-and-a-’alf in me tank,”
replied the taxi-driver, half-resuming his professional
air of martyrdom. “I been on this box since
eight this mornin’, and ain’t ’ad a bite o’ dinner;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
but I’ll take the lady anywheres in reason. She
ain’t <em>arst</em> me yet. I don’t want to be disobligin’
to nobody. ’Elp everybody, and everybody’ll
’elp you! That’s my motto. Give us a ’and,
matey”—to Al Thompson—“and back my
keb off the curb. Crank ’er up, Jock! Thanks!
Good-mornin’, all! Good-mornin’, sir!”</p>

<p>“Good-morning!” called the old gentleman.
“You have my card. Come and tell me how your
sons are doing. Meanwhile I’ll tackle those rascals.
We’ll get something done! Twice wounded! The
same old story! Oh, criminal! Monstrous! Da—”</p>

<p>The cab rattled away, leaving the old gentleman
to apostrophize His Majesty’s Government.
The Special, with the air of a man who has performed
a difficult and delicate task with consummate
tact, packed up his pocket-book and
resumed his beat.</p>

<p>“And now,” enquired the peevish voice of Joe
McCarthy, “<em>Where do we eat?</em>”</p>

<p>They dined at a red plush restaurant somewhere
off the Strand, and were introduced to some further
War economies.</p>

<p>First, the waitress. By rights she should have
been a waiter.</p>

<p>“Bin here nearly two years, now,” she informed
them. “The last man here was called up in March.
Sorry for the Army if there’s many more like him
in it. Flat feet, something cruel. Anyhow, there’s
only us girls now.”</p>

<p>“And varra nice, too!” ventured Andrew
Drummond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“None of your sauce, Scottie,” came the reply,
promptly, but without rancour.</p>

<p>“You’re married, ma’m, I see,” said Al Thompson
deferentially with a glance at her left hand.</p>

<p>“Widow,” said the girl briefly. “Since the
Somme, two years ago.”</p>

<p>“That’s too bad,” observed Al, painfully conscious
of the inadequacy of the remark.</p>

<p>“Most of us has lost some one. In the house
where my sister’s in service there’s three gone—all
officers. I’m not one to ask for sympathy when
there’s others needs it more,” replied this sturdy
little city sparrow. “Carry on—that’s my
motto! He was in the Field Artillery: just bin
promoted bombardier. Got any meat coupons?”</p>

<p>They shook their heads. As regularly rationed
soldiers they were free from such statutory fetters.</p>

<p>“Better have bacon and eggs,” announced
Hebe. “They’re not rationed.” She dealt them
each a slice of War bread. Butter they found was
unobtainable; so was sugar. Andrew suggested
that the party should solace itself with beer; but
his companions, like most Americans, whether
of the dry habit or the wet, preferred to drink
water with their actual meals. The fact that the
water when served was tepid received due comment
from Joe McCarthy.</p>

<p>“That’s the way folks always tak’ it here,”
explained Andrew. “I dinna often drink it mysel’,
I canna see what other kind o’ water ye could
expect.”</p>

<p>“You could put ice in it,” grunted Joe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ice?” The Scottish soldier explained the
omission with elaborate tact. “In this country,”
he pointed out, “ice is no obtainable in the summer-time.
We are situated here in the Temperate
Zone, and if a body needs ice, he has tae wait till
the winter for it. Oot in Amerikey I doot ye’ll
be able tae gather it all the year roond. Aye!
couldna fancy iced watter mysel’. It must be sair
cauld tae the stomach.”</p>

<p>Ice being unobtainable, it was obviously futile
to ask for ice-cream. Sweet corn the waitress had
never heard of: the mention of waffles merely
produced an indulgent shake of the head. However,
a timid enquiry for pie—after Andrew had
amended the wording to “tart”—was more
successful. It was obvious War-pie, but it satisfied.</p>

<p>“And,” enquired their conductor, as they
shouldered their way, full-fed, into the Strand,
“where are you boys for now?”</p>

<p>They were bound, it seemed, for a great Ball
Game between the American Navy and Army,
at a place called Stamford Bridge. This was outside
the ken of Andrew Drummond, but a policeman
directed their attention to the Underground
Railway System of London.</p>

<p>Presently they found themselves at the great
football ground, converted for the time being into
American territory. It is true that King George
himself sat in the Grand Stand, surrounded by
Generals, Admirals, and Councillors. It is true
that thousands of British soldiers, sailors, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
civilians lined the ground, and that British brass
bands made indefatigable music. But it was
America’s day. From the moment when the teams
lined up, and the two captains were presented to
the King by an American Vice-Admiral and an
American Major-General, the proceedings were
controlled by the fans and rooters of the American
Navy and Army.</p>

<p>How far the British contingent followed the
intricacies of the combat it is difficult to say.
When Al Thompson pointed out a sturdy but
medium-sized player, and announced that he had
once been a Giant, Andrew Drummond merely
wondered vaguely why he had shrunk. When
another player was uproariously identified as a
late Captain of the Red Socks, the English spectators
mentally registered the Red Socks as some
obsolescent Indian tribe—like the Blackfeet.</p>

<p>But you cannot, as has been well said during this
War, remain neutral on a moral issue. Within
twenty minutes every one on the ground was
shouting “Attaboy!” or consigning the umpire to
perdition, or endeavouring to imitate the concerted
war-songs of the rival sides. When the
sailors won the game by a narrow margin every
soldier present, American or British, lamented to
heaven.</p>

<p>“This is the End of a Perfect Day, I guess,”
remarked that most satisfactory guest, Al Thompson,
as the trio made their way arm in arm along
the crowded Strand in the cool of the evening.
“What do you say, Ed?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure!” replied Mr. Gillette. “Fine!”</p>

<p>“You all right, Joe?” enquired Al.</p>

<p>The carper made no reply, but looked about
him with a dissatisfied air.</p>

<p>“Seems to me,” he remarked querulously,
“that this War ain’t such a fierce proposition as
folks made out. Look at these people all enjoying
themselves.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess they done their day’s work,”
said Gillette pacifically. “Besides, most of them
are in khaki—or else that hospital uniform”—as
a string of <i lang="fr">char-à-bancs</i> conveying convalescents
to the theatre rattled cheerfully past.</p>

<p>But the misanthrope would not be denied.</p>

<p>“These here wounded don’t appear to be
wounded so bad,” he grumbled. “You don’t never
see no seriously wounded men in the streets of
this town.”</p>

<p>“No,” rapped out Al Thompson, ruffled for
once, “and you don’t see no dead laying around
neither! I guess if you was to take a walk through
a hospital, Joe McCarthy—No, you can cancel
the hospital. This will do.”</p>

<p>They had reached Charing Cross Station. From
the farther gate streamed a slow-moving procession
of loaded Red Cross ambulances. Another
procession, empty, was moving in at the nearer
gate, to disappear inside the station. Down an
adjacent street stretched a line of more ambulances,
and more yet. But the busy crowd in the Strand
gave little heed to the spectacle. They had witnessed
it, or could have witnessed it, at this hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and in this place, among others, any evening
during the past four years.</p>

<p>Our friends halted, waiting for an opening in
the close-moving stream. Presently it slowed
down and stopped, and Joe McCarthy led the way
across. But he paused curiously, as did the others,
at the open back of an ambulance, and peered in.</p>

<p>The car contained four passengers. Each lay
very still upon his stretcher—two upon the floor,
and the other two packed neatly on shelves overhead.
All were rolled up in brown Army blankets.
From the end of one of these protruded a heavily
splinted and bandaged foot. Another man had
his arm strapped across his chest. The third lay
on his face, his back torn by shrapnel. The fourth
lay on his back. His head was swathed in bandages,
and only one eye was visible. It was closed.
One hand was bandaged; the other clasped to his
bosom a German sniper’s helmet.</p>

<p>As they gazed, another figure edged in beside
them—a London flower-girl, in the usual dilapidated
shawl and deplorable hat, with her fragrant
stock-in-trade clasped in the hollow of her left
arm. She plucked a couple of pink carnations from
a bundle, and flung them to the man with the
bandaged head.</p>

<p>“For you, ole sport,” she announced, “with
my love. So long!”</p>

<p>The wounded man opened his visible eye and
smiled his thanks; and the girl was passing on to
the next ambulance, there to squander more of her
sole means of livelihood, when a hand of iron fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
upon her shoulder. On the defensive in a moment,
she whirled round.</p>

<p>“Nar, then! You stop pawin’ me! I never done
no—”</p>

<p>But Joe McCarthy, misanthrope, merely deprived
her of the bundle of pink carnations, placing
in her grimy palm in exchange all the money he
happened to have with him. It was roughly three
days’ pay—no mean sum in the most highly paid
Army in the world. Then leaning into the ambulance,
which had begun to move again, he deposited
the flowers beside the wounded soldier, and
said gruffly:</p>

<p>“Say, Tommy!”</p>

<p>The solitary eye opened again, and a voice
replied:</p>

<p>“Tommy yourself! I’m from Elizabeth, New
Jersey. We’re all Doughboys in here.”</p>

<p>The Three Musketeers, thrilled to the core,
broke into a trot, and panted:</p>

<p>“You don’t say? Where you been fighting?”</p>

<p>“Place called Belleau Wood. Good-night, boys!”</p>

<p>It was their first contact with actuality.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_EIGHT">CHAPTER EIGHT<br />
<span class="smaller">THE PROMISED LAND</span></h2>

<p>We have now discovered France. Our first impression
of that fair but voluble land is one of amazement
that the inhabitants should be able to speak
such a difficult language so fluently. Even the
children can do it.</p>

<p>Later, we modified that opinion—either because
we found that the French tongue was not
so difficult as we had imagined, or more probably
because we had learned that in France a knowledge
of French is not so indispensable—at any rate,
in war-time—as we had imagined. Indeed, we
found the French language quite as intelligible
as some of the English rural dialects. Contrariwise,
the French appeared to understand our mode
of expression much more readily than some of our
English hosts.</p>

<p>For instance, if you ask an English railway
porter for such a simple thing as the check-room
or the news-stand, he will simply gape at you;
whereas, if you stride into a French country hotel
and hold up one finger—naturally one has to
employ gesture just a little with the Latin races—and
say “Oon room!” in a firm voice, the proprietor
will comprehend at once, and smilingly
hand you a key right away. One can only ascribe
this instant sympathy to the freemasonry of a
common democratic ideal. Or it may be that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
room is the only thing which a hotel proprietor
could expect a stranger carrying a grip to ask for.</p>

<p>However, this by the way. The main point is
that we are at last in France—France, the land
of the Great Adventure, for which our ardent
dreams and hard training have been shaping us
for months past.</p>

<p>Still, at first sight it is not too easy to realize
that we are there at all; for the surroundings in
which we found ourselves on landing might have
been lifted bodily from Hoboken.</p>

<p>Speaking of Hoboken, we note that the prevailing
slogan of the moment, posted on barrack walls,
painted on transport wagons, even blazoned in
stencilled letters across the wind-shields of Staff
automobiles, is: <i>Heaven, Hell, or Hoboken by
Christmas!</i> To this pious aspiration one ardent
spirit has added, in smaller lettering: <i>But let it be
Hoboken, please, via Berlin!</i></p>

<p>Certainly, the Armies of Invasion, both friendly
and hostile, have transformed France, each in its
own way. The Hun in the east has effected his
share of the transformation in his own way, by
fire, rapine, and pillage. But the British and
Americans in the west have left a mark just as
unmistakable and, it is to be hoped, more enduring.
A great army cannot disembark upon the soil
of another people’s country without importing
a great deal of its own personality at the same
time. That accounts for the foregoing reference to
Hoboken. The amount of portable property that
we have brought with us is enormous. There were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
days, not far distant, when a soldier subsisted
upon the country wherein he found himself.
During the Shenandoah Valley campaign Stonewall
Jackson’s men lived on unripe corn and green
apples, for the very good reason that there existed
no means of providing them with anything else.
Throughout the centuries this fact has kept expeditionary
forces down to reasonable numbers;
the size of an army was limited to the capacity of
the country to support it. But modern science has
changed all that. Canned meat has revolutionized
warfare far more surely and permanently than the
aeroplane or the submarine. It is now possible, by
modern methods of food preservation and transportation,
to arm practically a whole nation and
maintain it continuously and comfortably in the
field thousands of miles from its base of supplies.
That is why France is the most overcrowded and
best-fed country in the world to-day.</p>

<p>Modern transportation has also made possible—which
in warfare means indispensable—the
intensive employment of heavy artillery. We use
siege guns to-day where yesterday we employed
eighteen-pounders and seventy-fives. That involves
the construction of complicated railroad
systems—tracks, sidings, locomotives, ammunition-wagons—all
over the country, operating
forward and sideways behind the line. Two years
ago—twelve months ago—the spot where we
find ourselves was a sleepy third-rate seaport,
whose very existence was known to few English-speaking
people, save the captains of Channel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
coasters. To-day that port still slumbers in the
Brittany sunshine, but it has thrown out an
<i lang="fr">annexe</i> many times larger than itself, comprising
a complete system of docks and basins, two hundred
and fifty miles of railroad siding, and enough
storage accommodation to house two million tons
of military supplies.</p>

<p>But American activity has not halted there. To
secure a provision of fair drinking-water for the
huge population of this mushroom city the Engineers
have constructed a great reservoir among the
foothills a few miles away—an enterprise which
frankly astonishes the natives, to whom, in common
with the rest of their countrymen, water as a
beverage is unknown.</p>

<p>One other item—an inevitable item—swells
the population of the district. This is the great
American Base Hospital, which has been erected
by the side of the main road leading inland from
the coast. The hospital is a city in itself. Its buildings,
cunningly isolated one from another, cover
many acres, and contain twenty-four thousand
beds. Thank God, these have never yet all been
occupied at one time.</p>

<p>And this great base port is only one of several.
That fact is borne in upon us at every turn by the
prevalence of large printed signs, headed, <i>Race to
Berlin!</i> which plaster the town. Upon these signs
are printed in column down the left-hand side the
names of all the base ports used by American
troops—our own port among the number. At
the opposite edge of the sign there is a great black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
splash, marked <span class="smcap">Berlin</span>. The splash is connected
to each of the base ports by a straight black line.
On each line, at varying distances from the base
ports, stands a small movable flag. The big idea,
any passer-by will tell you, is to stimulate activity
among the units forming the Service of Supply by
means of healthy competition. Every good day’s
work in any port sets the flag of that port an inch
or two nearer Berlin. A port is not called upon to
compete with other ports (which would be manifestly
unfair, for some are larger and better
equipped than others), but only with its own
previous record in the matter of unloading ships,
and the like.</p>

<p>Attached to each diagram is a printed notice,
pointing out in simple language that hard work
at the base is just as indispensable as hard fighting
at the front, and that when Victory comes the
credit will be shared equally by both departments.
The notice is signed <i>John J. Pershing</i>, and it has
roused the dusky warriors at the various base
ports to a fever of emulation.</p>

<p>Certainly there is much to unload. An army
carries as much personal baggage as a prima donna.
Observe these wharves. Here are great naval guns—fourteen-inch.
They are like millionaires, because
each requires a private railway train of its
own. In fact they are super-millionaires, because
each requires a private track as well. There are
great motor-lorries, some from America, some
from England. There is a fleet of rolling kitchens—or
“soup-guns,” as the Doughboy calls them-awaiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
horse-traction. At present they are
hitched one behind another like a string of ducks,
and are attached to a road engine for transference
to the forward areas. There are mighty Mogul
locomotives, shipped bodily from the United
States, together with the appurtenances thereof—even
that mysterious tolling bell on top of the boiler.</p>

<p>The American locomotive bell impresses Europeans
enormously. They wonder what it is for. On
the whole they regard it with reverence; it confers
a sort of ecclesiastical sanctity upon American
railroad travel. A Scotsman once told me that
whenever he visited America he used frequently
to wake up in the sleeping-car, standing in some
great railroad junction in the small hours, under
the firm impression that he was back in his native
town on a Sunday morning.</p>

<p>As for the ordinary military stores, they come
in one unceasing cataract. Gasoline tanks; water-tanks;
cold-storage carcasses; bags of flour; canned
meat; canned fruit; bales of clothing; consignments
of tobacco; chewing-gum, books, and other
comforts. Liberty motors; aeroplanes; machine
guns; spare parts. The dingy, oddly painted ships
come sliding down from the horizon, deposit them
all in mountain ranges upon dock and wharf, then
turn round and steal back to America for more.</p>

<p>Shells are not landed here. They are touchy and
inflammable folk, and have a private and exclusive
place of debarkation of their own, higher up the
river.</p>

<p>But there is human freight to be deposited too.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Here are two liners, newly docked. Each, despite
her great size, is heeling over towards the wharf, as
the biggest ships will when the whole cargo hangs
over one side. One cargo is white, the other coloured.</p>

<p>“Where yo’ from?” shrieks a stevedore, to the
dusky grinning human mountain above him.</p>

<p>“Seventy fo’, Fo’teen Street, Lebanon, Illinois!”
pipes a solitary voice far up the height, before any
one else can answer the question. There is a roar
of laughter at this egotism, and another voice
from the wharf enquires:</p>

<p>“What camp?”</p>

<p>“Camp Dodge! Labour Battalion!” roars an
answering chorus.</p>

<p>“Step right down, boys! We got lots of labour
for you heah!” yells the humorist on the wharf.</p>

<p>The white contingent on the other ship proves
to be from Camp Sherman. What is of far more
importance, however, is the fact that both ships
possess clean bills of health, only nine cases of
sickness being reported altogether. This is good
news, for influenza and pneumonia have been rampant.
Troops on the great transports have been
saddened of late by the continuous spectacle of
eager young hearts committed to the deep without
ever having beheld their Promised Land. There
have been rumours, too, of hundreds of stretcher-cases
landed in Liverpool from a single convoy.
But apparently the plague is stayed. We shall
have a chance now to be killed—which is a very
different matter from dying like a common civilian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>In due course the gentleman from Fourteenth
Street, Lebanon, Illinois, set foot upon the soil of
France—to his own profound relief. His name was
Joseph Williams. His calling, up to date, had been
that of elevator attendant in the leading—in fact,
the only—hotel in his native town. He had never
been from home in his life, and when the long arm
of the Selective Draft reached out from Washington,
D.C., and pounced upon Joseph in Lebanon
and dropped him into the maelstrom of Camp
Dodge, it launched him upon a series of experiences
so novel and so surprising that his eyes had never
quite regained their sockets, nor had his mouth
been completely closed, since. American negroes
vary a good deal in tint, but there were no half-measures
about Joseph. He was coal-black; and
as his teeth and the whites of his eyes were china-white,
he furnished a most effective colour-scheme.
He was, moreover, a youth of cheerful countenance,
and performed the most ordinary military
duties with an air of rapturous enjoyment.</p>

<p>But the voyage across had been a severe trial.
Joseph had never seen the ocean before, and his
introduction to that element had not been auspicious.
For fifteen long days the convoy had
tumbled and lurched through the Atlantic wastes.
The weather had been contrary; fogs numerous.
The lame ducks of the party had been more than
usually dilatory. Joseph and his brethren—possibly
with some long-dormant ancestral chord of
recollection astir within them—had been first
scared, then demoralized, and finally had given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
up hope. After the first week they abandoned all
expectation of ever seeing land again. Late one
night the officer on duty, going his rounds amid
the Chinese opium-den of close-packed bunks in
the ship’s hold, overheard Joseph’s voice, uplifted
above the creaking of timbers and the snores of
his associates, imploring Providence for the sight
of “jus’ one li’l’ lone pine-tree—no mo’ dan dat!”—as
a divine guarantee that the deep waters of
the Atlantic had not entirely submerged the
habitable globe.</p>

<p>But now, Joseph had arrived. He was “right
there.” The sun shone warmly upon him, and the
good brown earth lay firm beneath his large feet—the
soil of France, which he had come to save.
His smile expanded: his soul burgeoned. He would
explore this town, and fraternize with the inhabitants.</p>

<p>Leave obtained, he set forth. He observed with
approval, as a member of a family which had derived
its income for generations from the taking-in
of other people’s washing, the elaborately
starched and frilled caps of the Normandy fisherwomen.
He returned with interest the shy smiles
of little French girls in wooden sabots. When a
bullet-headed little French boy in a long black
pinafore stood to attention upon his approach and
exclaimed, “<i lang="fr">Américain, Salu-u-u-ut!</i>” Joseph Williams
beamed from ear to ear.</p>

<p>Presently, emerging from the town, he made for
the open country—a country of undulating sand-dunes,
with here and there a windmill atop, feverishly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
churning. To these succeeded green fields,
dotted with humble farms and homesteads. Joseph
observed that all these buildings were of stone or
brick, wood being doubtless unobtainable in this
sterile country. The inhabitants were not numerous—able-bodied
men were conspicuously absent—and
every one within sight appeared to be working.
In the nearest field a small boy was directing
the movements of two placid horses by means of
that peculiar agonized howl with which a Frenchman
always conducts business of an urgent nature,
whether he be reviling a political opponent or selling
evening papers. Farther away an oldish man in
French Territorial uniform was cutting hay, assisted
by two strapping young women.</p>

<p>Even the very old and the very young were employed.
And in this connection Joseph stumbled
upon the ideal occupation for persons who possess
those twin adjuncts of the philosopher—a contemplative
mind and a dislike for work.</p>

<p>Hitherto the summit of his ambition had been to
stand one day in glorious apparel upon the tessellated
flooring of a great New York hotel, opposite
the elevators, and nod his head in Jove-like fashion
whenever he thought it desirable that another elevator
should go up. But now another and more
restful career presented itself to him.</p>

<p>Every French peasant possesses a cow or two—peradventure
half a dozen. To feed these, pastureland
is required. But no thrifty Frenchman would
set aside valuable arable land for this purpose,
when the roadside is free to all. A properly educated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
French cow can always be relied upon to extract
a meal from the strip of dusty herbage that
runs between the roadway and the ditch in every
country lane in France. The trouble is that such a
pasture is considerably longer than it is broad—three
feet by Infinity is the dimension—and a
cow of epicurean temperament may be inclined to
wander too far, or even lose herself. Therefore, an
escort must be provided—usually for each individual
cow, for the collective convoy system is of
little practical use here. So the Landsturm is called
out. At early dawn Grandpère totters off up the
road escorting, let us say, Rosalie; while Toinette,
aged six, departs in the opposite direction, with
the inevitable huge umbrella under one arm and
Victorine’s leading-string under the other. Thus
the day is spent. It is a day without haste, without
heat; for the pace is that of a browsing cow. Moreover,
it is a day without supervision—grateful
and comforting to an enlisted man of six months’
standing—and its responsibilities are limited to
steering the cow out of the way of approaching
traffic, either by personal appeal from the shade of
a neighbouring tree, or in extreme cases with the
umbrella. It is not necessary to observe a course or
take bearings: you may simply drift, because the
cow always knows the way home. Decidedly, said
Joseph Williams to himself, this was the life. Elevator-starting
was a sociable and decorative calling,
but made too severe a demand upon the faculties.
After the war he would settle right here in
France and chaperon a cow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>It was at this point that Joseph went finally to
sleep, in the shadow of the cow which had started
his train of thought. He awoke greatly refreshed—he
had arrears of sleep to make up after the discomforts
of the voyage—and set out for the
town, with his mind a luxurious blank, except for
two small matters. First, the entire absence of any
suggestion of war. Joseph had half expected to find
his landing disputed by the full strength of the
German Army. Conversation on board had tended
that way, and he had promised himself a happy
hour writing home to describe how he, followed by
his devoted adherents, had triumphantly overcome
the foe’s resistance. In fact, he had written
the letter already. Second, every one in this country
appeared to be white—French soldiers, French
sailors, French civilians. He longed for the sight of
one ebony face. Even a mahogany one would do.</p>

<p>And on the outskirts of the town the latter
wish was gratified. A sudden turn in the road
brought him face to face with his own double—or
very nearly. The double was attired in what Joseph
took to be a French uniform of some kind, the most
conspicuous and enviable items of which were immensely
baggy trousers and a red fez.</p>

<p>The double, after one glance at Joseph’s modest
khaki uniform and homely features, broke into a
dazzling smile. The pair advanced rapidly upon
one another and shook hands with enormous enthusiasm.
Both broke into speech simultaneously.</p>

<p>Then befell the tragedy. Each spoke a tongue
entirely incomprehensible to the other!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Each paused, incredulous; then, convinced
there must be some mistake, began again. Then
came another pause. A look of almost pathetic bewilderment
appeared upon each honest countenance—countenances
almost identical in shade
and feature. Then Joseph exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Why, nigger, what so’t of fancy nigger does yo’
think yo’ is?”</p>

<p>The gentleman in the fez retaliated with a query
which, to judge by sound and intonation, was very
similar to Joseph’s.</p>

<p>The look of bewilderment on Joseph’s face
gave place to a severe frown, which was immediately
reflected in that of his double. Each of these
children of Ham now darkly suspected the other of
imposture.</p>

<p>“Don’ yo’ go an’ get fresh with <em>me</em>, nigger!” said
Joseph, in a warning voice.</p>

<p>“<em>Yakki-wakki-hikki-doolah!</em>” growled the other—or
words to that effect.</p>

<p>Joseph lost all patience. His voice suddenly shot
up an octave higher, and he screamed:</p>

<p>“You ain’t no nigger at all! You’re only a
Af’ican!”</p>

<p class="tb">Possibly it was in self-compensation for this disillusioning
encounter that Joseph promptly mailed
to his affianced in distant Lebanon, Illinois, the
letter which has been mentioned above. It began:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Well, honey, we has arrived in France, and this war sure
is fierce. Every time I steps outside my dugout I wades up
to my knees in blood.…</i></p>

</div>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_NINE">CHAPTER NINE<br />
<span class="smaller">THE EXILES</span></h2>

<p>So tremendous was America’s response when in
the spring of this year the call came to her from the
Western Front to hurry, so overwhelming the host
which she sent over, that our chief difficulty to-day
is not to withstand the Hun, but to find a vacant
spot on his carcass to hit.</p>

<p>We have been in France for over a month now,
but so far our services as a unit have not been required
in the Line. But we are acclimatized by this
time. The days of our green youth in the big camps
back home have faded away as though they never
had been. In this Old-World, constricted country
it requires quite an effort of memory to recall those
spacious days upon our own open, rolling plains
and hillsides. Gone are the great streets of wooden
two-storey huts, with their electric light, steam
heat, and hot showers; the various social centres;
the roaring Liberty Theatre and the Hostess
House; the candy-stores and the shoe-shine parlours.
They are but a memory, blurred by four
months of incredibly novel experience.</p>

<p>To-day we sleep in French barracks—bleak,
cheerless buildings, redolent of floor-soap and whitewash;
or in billets up and down a little village; or
in some great barn, on straw, or under the summer
stars in our dog-tents. We perform our ablutions in
the open air, mainly at a farm pump or street hydrant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
to the diversion of the female population.
For recreation we still play baseball; for creature
comforts we can turn to the Red Cross, or the
Y.M.C.A., or the Knights of Columbus, or the
Salvation Army, or the Jewish Welfare Board.
There is also a French institution, known as <i lang="fr">Le
Foyer du Soldat</i>, where we consort with grave-faced,
courteous <i lang="fr">poilus</i>. We have encountered no
British troops so far. They are farther north: several
of our units have gone up to be brigaded with
them.</p>

<p>So here we are—right here in France—absorbing
new atmosphere through our pores. We
are on a strict war footing, too. Everything, as the
Colonel has explained to us, must be “just so.” If
you are ordered to be at a certain cross-road ten
miles away, with your company, at 9 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> to-morrow
morning, with picks and shovels and two days’
rations, you have to be there—just there—not
at 9.05, with picks but no shovels, or with one day’s
rations instead of two, but at 9 precisely, with the
exact outfit prescribed. The accomplishment of
this feat is not so easy as it sounds: it involves
much study, and occasional weariness of the flesh.
You must be able not only to read a map correctly,
but to visualize from a scrutiny of the same the
exact nature of the country through which you are
going to lead your company—whether it is hilly
or no; whether the hill runs up or down; whether
there are grade crossings or narrow bridges or one-way
roads to be considered; whether a ford marked
“Passable for troops” is also passable for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
wheeled transport which carries your picks and
shovels. All these possibilities make for delay—sometimes
most excusable delay. But excuses
are not accepted in war-time. Either you succeed
or you fail: there is no intermediate stage. Boone
Cruttenden’s plan—and a very good one too—is
to try experiments, not upon his men, but upon
himself. In his spare moments he is accustomed to
figure out, with the aid of the map and a mekometer,
how long it would take a body of armed men to
cover some given distance on the map, having regard
to the possibility of—</p>

<p>(1) Unexpectedly heavy going.</p>

<p>(2) Roads blocked by other troops.</p>

<p>(3) Having to scatter or take cover, owing to enemy aeroplanes.</p>

<p>(4) The cussedness of transport mules.</p>

<p>(5) Other visitations of Providence.</p>

<p>He then enlists the services of a friend—usually
Jim Nichols—and the pair proceed to test their
own theories by performing the journey in person,
at the pace of a marching company, correcting their
calculations as they proceed. It is upon such painful
foundations that your true soldier is built up.</p>

<p>And discipline is rigid. If the top sergeant instructs
Mr. Joe McCarthy to empty certain buckets
of kitchen garbage, and that right speedily, Joe
no longer explains that he is here not to empty
garbage, but to make the world safe for Democracy.
He simply departs with the buckets, somewhat
dazed at his own alacrity. War has her victories, no
less than Peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Saluting is universal now. We take a pride in it.
Formerly we did not. Our independent natures
rebelled against its suggestion of servility. But we
have recently realized that a slave is a man who
bends his knee and bows his head. A soldier does
neither. He holds himself erect, looks his brother in
arms straight in the face, and exchanges with him
the proudest of all masonic signs.</p>

<p>We are much interested in the saluting methods
of our Allies. The Frenchman salutes with the
open hand, palm forward and fingers pointing upward.
The Britisher brings his elbow into play, and
salutes with horizontal forearm. Both French and
British officers salute in different fashion from
their men.</p>

<p>The British practise strange refinements of their
own. Bond, the stout medical Major whom last we
met travelling in a railway compartment from
Liverpool,—yes, we may as well divulge it; it was
Liverpool,—was one of the first Americans to
make a serious attempt to grapple with the fundamental
laws of the subject. Almost immediately on
arrival he was sent to Belgium, with other members
of the craft, to render invaluable assistance at
a British Casualty Clearing-Station not far from
Ypres—that graveyard of British soldiers and
German hopes. He observed with approval the
punctilious, if complicated, fashion in which all
ranks greeted one another in public places, and set
himself to take notes and master the combination.
Two months later, a prey to overstrain, he
took a week’s leave in Paris, where he encountered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
that eccentric but companionable Anglo-American,
Major Floyd.</p>

<p>They exchanged greetings and news. Floyd, it
seemed, was now attached to the American Army,
having been appointed a liaison officer. Then Bond
said: “Floyd, I am glad I met you. You are one of
the most lucid exponents of British institutions in
captivity, and I want you to explain to me just
half a dozen or so of the most common variations
of the British military salute.”</p>

<p>Floyd nodded sympathetically.</p>

<p>“I know,” he said. “It seems complicated, but
all you have to do is to get hold of the fundamental
idea. Here it is. The one thing a British soldier
must never do is to remove his cap.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“If he takes it off, he is ‘improperly dressed’;
and that practically disqualifies him from ‘getting
on with the war’ for the time being. So he remains
covered, indoors and out, except in church and
during certain portions of the burial service. In
fact, at moments of ceremonial intensity, such as
the playing of the National Anthem, when civilians
are reverently baring their heads, the soldier has
to grab his cap and put it on quickly.”</p>

<p>“Otherwise he cannot come to the salute?”</p>

<p>“Cannot? Must not! It is a military crime to
salute bareheaded. It says so in the book.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Bond musingly. “That accounts
for the fact that if I happened to meet a hospital
orderly around the Casualty Clearing-Station without
his cap, he never saluted me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“Precisely.”</p>

<p>“Then why—” Bond hesitated.</p>

<p>“I know your trouble,” said Floyd, fixing his
melancholy gaze upon the Major’s puzzled face.
“Instead of saluting you, he gave you a glare of
withering contempt?”</p>

<p>“He certainly did. But how did you know?”</p>

<p>“Because that was what it looked like—to you.
In reality the poor fellow was only doing what the
Book says. He was turning his head ‘smartly
towards the officer, while passing.’”</p>

<p>“That explains quite a lot. I was afraid it was I
who was in wrong in some way, and he wanted to
tell me so, but was prevented by the bonds of discipline
from doing more than give me a good fierce
look.”</p>

<p>“His proceeding was perfectly regular,” said
Floyd gravely. “But that is not all. A British soldier
is debarred from saluting not only when bareheaded,
but whenever he is occupied in such a manner
as to prevent him doing the thing in proper
style. For instance, if you meet Tommy carrying a
bucket or riding a bicycle, he merely gives his celebrated
head-jerk, without employing his hand at
all.”</p>

<p>“That is a good notion,” said Bond. “I shall
adopt it. Last week I was riding a bicycle myself,
and I nearly broke my collar-bone through letting
go with one hand in order to salute a Brigadier-General
in a muddy lane. Luckily I fell soft!”</p>

<p>“It’s a carefully thought-out system,” agreed
Floyd, “and perfectly sound. Nearly everything in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the British Drill Book is—so far as it goes. In
nineteen fourteen that Drill Book put into the field
the finest army that has ever fought under the British
flag. Unfortunately very few of the nation had
read it. When the War broke out there were still
some forty millions of us who regarded it as a purely
humorous publication. If they had listened to Lord
Roberts and absorbed its gritty contents, instead
of lapping up predigested pap from the politicians,
perhaps there would have been no War. Anyway,
some of my best friends would have been alive to-day.
Those were the fellows, Bond! In the First
Battle of Ypres three divisions of them, dead beat
after eight weeks’ continuous fighting, stopped four
fresh German Army Corps. The Drill Book taught
them how to do that. They have mostly gone West
now; but I for one will salute their memory so long
as I live, cap or no cap!”</p>

<p class="tb">We are marching up the Loire now, getting nearer
the front of things every day. Nantes is behind us—an
ancient city astride the river, its historic
quays crowded with American shipping and its
wharves piled high with the products of those two
mighty Allied bases, Chicago and Minneapolis.</p>

<p>The Loire is a pleasant stream. It is neither so
broad as the Mississippi nor so deep as the Hudson,
but it will serve. Shoals and sand-bars are frequent
upon its surface, but on the opposite side the bank
rises up to a quite respectable height, pleasantly
reminiscent, at one or two points, of the Palisades.</p>

<p>And the towns we pass through are fascinating.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
For one thing, they come upon you suddenly.
American towns absorb you gradually. First an
outlying suburb, with maybe the terminus of the
street-car system. Then an untidy No Man’s Land,
neither cultivated nor inhabited—mainly vacant
building lots—decorated along the route with
huge advertisements, chiefly of automobile accessories.
Here and there you pass a gasoline station
or roadhouse. After that, by degrees, trim
white wooden houses, with shady piazzas; increasing
traffic; and finally, fifteen-storey office-buildings,
shops, hotels, and the roar of the town.</p>

<p>But in Central France these premonitory symptoms
are lacking. Your company tramps along the
winding road beside the river, through country cultivated
to its last yard—a country of hedges and
ditches and enclosed fields. A bend in the stream,
and lo! before you rises a venerable city, piled up
on the ground rising from the river, with ancient
bridges spanning the stream and a grey cathedral
crowning the whole. There are no suburbs, no advertising
boards, no gasoline stations. The sea of
green turf continues to the edge of the city, and
very often laps against ramparts a thousand years
old. You march in under the resounding arch of an
ancient gateway.</p>

<p>The streets are narrow; the gradient is frequently
such as to discommode any one save a native of
Lynchburg, Virginia. The shops are small, and the
proprietors thereof appear to transact most of their
business upon the doorstep. The inhabitants are
friendly, especially the children. But most welcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
sight of all, wherever we march, and through whatever
town or village we pass, there are familiar
greetings awaiting us, in the form of signs over
doorways or at street-corners, thus—<i>A.E.F. Commanding
General’s Headquarters</i>; or, <i>To A.P.M.’s
Office</i>; or, <i>American Red Cross Headquarters</i>. And at
each street-crossing, upright, sunburned, and immensely
alert, stands an American Military Policeman,
directing the tide of country carts, errant
cows, antediluvian street-cars, despatch-riders,
motor-cycles, and marching troops, with all the
solemn austerity of a New York Traffic Cop.</p>

<p>If the American soldier has one characteristic
which singles him out from the rest of the Allies, it
is that Home is seldom absent from his thoughts—possibly
because he is farther away from home than
any one else. It is true that more water rolls between,
say, France and Australia, than between
France and America. But then to the Australian
England itself is Home. In his own land he still refers
to her as such. The true exile in this war is the
American-born Doughboy. In most cases he has
never been outside his own great and beautiful land
before, for the simple reason that he has always
found abundant elbow-room therein; and if the desire
to roam has ever possessed him, he has been
able to gratify it without stepping off the soil of his
country or even beyond the border of his own State.
Therein he is in different case from the inhabitants
of those congested islets, Great Britain and Ireland,
many of whose younger sons are thrust out in early
life by the concomitant forces of natural increase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
and external pressure from the land of their birth
to seek a living in distant portions of the globe—and
in so doing have quite inadvertently created
that unmethodical, loosely connected organization
known as the British Empire, which is either a federation
of free communities, providing decent government
where otherwise there would be no government
at all, or else a voracious octopus, according
to the way you look at it.</p>

<p>But the American soldier, being for the most part
familiar with no country but his own, adapts himself
less happily to foreign conditions than Britons who
have been schooled by stern necessity to make
themselves equally comfortable in Wei-Hai-Wei or
Wigan. Add to this the natural outspoken American
affection for, and belief in, American institutions
and mode of life, and you will understand why
American troops on the march through Europe will
cheer themselves hoarse at the sight of such reminders
of Home as an American policeman directing
the traffic in a French town, or an imported
American locomotive puffing along a French railroad.</p>

<p>And there is one other American institution for
which the American soul thirsts in this barren land—the
American newspaper. Behold us billeted for
a day or two in the little town of Crapaudville-sur-Loire.
Existence there is a series of <i lang="fr">queues</i>. In the
morning we arise right early and make a careful
toilet. For this purpose we form a <i lang="fr">queue</i>, or water-line,
at the town pump. This is not a lengthy business,
because it does not take long to fill a pannikin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
with water: the only interruptions which occur are
due to natural gallantry, as when an attractive
Ally arrives to fill her family kettle. After that
comes breakfast-time, which entails standing in another
<i lang="fr">queue</i>, or chow-line. After that as many of us
as can contrive to do so hurry off to stand in the
most important <i lang="fr">queue</i> of the day—the news-line.
A train from Paris, of arthritic tendencies and irregular
habits, is due about noon, bearing newspapers,
which are doled out at a price of twenty-five
centimes.</p>

<p>There are, of course, sharp degrees of comparison.
The great Paris morning journals are nothing
in our young lives. They are written in a language
which we do not know, and their headlines are lacking
in enterprise. The Paris issue of the <cite>London Daily
Mail</cite> is better. It reaches us in the form of a special
American edition, which caters generously to our
national predilection for type several inches high.
But beyond that it does not go. <em>Blossom and blossom
and blossom, but never the promise of fruit!</em> The
reading matter below the headlines is constrained,
lacking in pep—dead stuff. At least, so Joe McCarthy
says. The Paris editions of the <cite>New York
Herald</cite> and <cite>Chicago Tribune</cite> furnish more nourishment,
although in these days of paper famine they
are sadly attenuated affairs—mere single sheets,
sometimes. Then there is our own A.E.F. weekly—<cite>The
Stars and Stripes</cite>. It is ably conducted and full
of meat; but at the best it is only an official publication,
mainly about the War. And it was not
printed in America. What we crave for is home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
news—home gossip—home advertisements. A
single copy of an American Sunday newspaper,
with comic supplement complete, would fetch its
weight in dollar bills over here. Our spirits yearn
to participate once more in the Bringing up of
Father, or the fratricidal rivalries of Mutt and
Jeff; or to witness the perennial discomfitures of
those two intensely human impostors, Percy and
Ferdy. Even those nasty little Boche abortions,
the Katzenjammer Kids, would be something.</p>

<p>The happiest man is he who receives once in a
while a copy of his local newspaper from home.
These come rarely enough, for second-class mail
matter is incurring mysterious casualties these
days.</p>

<p>However, one of these priceless packages arrived
not long ago for Eddie Gillette, all the way from a
little town in the Northwest. Eddie tore off the
wrapper, and almost set his teeth into the paper.
Everything was there for which his soul hungered—news
about America, about his own town, about
people whom he knew personally—conveyed by
means of the arresting headline, the pointed
phrase, and the intellectual pemmican of the heavily
leaded summary. The War news, of course, was
weeks old, but Ed devoured it rapturously. He
knew now how the War was really going.</p>

<p>“This guy Allenby must be some dandy fighter,”
he observed to Al Thompson, looking up.</p>

<p>“Sure, Ed!” replied Al pleasantly. “Why?”</p>

<p>“He’s been doing fine in the Holy Land. See
what it says here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Ed held up the newspaper for Al to see, and
pointed to the head of a column:</p>

<p class="center">BRITISH CRUSADERS IN NAZARETH</p>

<p class="center">ALLENBY WINS JESUS CHRIST’S HOME TOWN
FROM TURKS</p>

<p>“That’s the goods!” remarked Ed approvingly,
as he folded the paper with reverent care and tucked
it inside his shirt. “The feller that writes that stuff
has gotten the real idea for a story. The others
over here”—designating apparently the editors
of the London <cite>Times</cite> and Paris <cite lang="fr">Matin</cite>—“ain’t
got nothing <em>to</em> them. No, <em>sir</em>! They don’t write
nothing but small-town stuff!”</p>

<p>“You said it, Ed!” agreed Al.</p>

<p>“All the same,” observed the critic, rising and
stretching his giant limbs, “this yer reading the
papers from home may give a feller a grand and
glorious feeling, but it makes him feel mighty lonesome
and homesick too.” He raised a pair of great
fists heavenward. “Oh, <em>Boy</em>! when I get back
home after this War, if the Statue of Liberty ever
wants to see Ed Gillette again, she’ll have to turn
around to do it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_TEN">CHAPTER TEN<br />
<span class="smaller">S.O.S. TO DILLPICKLE</span></h2>

<p>To most of us hitherto the letters <i>S.O.S.</i> have signified
calamity of some kind—appeals for succour
from sinking liners, and the like. Our British liaison
officers, too, tell us that S.O.S. is the epithet
applied to the rockets which are always kept in position
in British front-line trenches, to be discharged
as an urgent intimation to the gunners behind that
the enemy are attacking in mass.</p>

<p>But in the American Army S.O.S. means “Service
of Supply.” It denotes, not panic, but order,
and control, and abundance. It covers the whole
chainwork of activity known in most armies as the
“Lines of Communication.” The town where we
find ourselves to-day is a great S.O.S. centre. On its
outskirts lie mushroom cities of huts and sheds.
Here is a great cold-storage depot: there are eight
thousand tons of frozen beef in this single building.
Here is a big station for assembling aeroplanes,
where de Haviland planes of British design are
being fitted with Liberty engines. Through the town
itself there flows by night and by day a never-failing
stream of food and munitions and replacement
troops. Needless to say the town lies upon one of
the main roads along which the Race to Berlin is
being run.</p>

<p>Back along that road, alas! streams another
current—a counter-current—of wastage, material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
and human. Upon its surface is borne all the
dreadful litter of the battlefield—rusty rifles,
damaged equipment, blood-soaked uniforms. Here
is a mighty depot, which handles and repairs
such wreckage. These buildings have all been constructed
within the past few months. It would
take you half a day to walk through them. In at
one end of the establishment goes a squalid torrent
of torn clothing, unmated shoes, leaky rubber
trench boots, odds and ends of equipment. In due
course, after a drastic series of laundering, sorting,
patching, stitching, or vulcanizing experiences—mainly
at the hands of a twittering army corps
of Frenchwomen—each item in this melancholy
jumble finds itself reincarnated in various storehouses
in the form of properly assorted pairs of
boots and shoes, neat second-hand uniforms, and
complete sets of equipment. Nothing is wasted.
Stetson hats damaged beyond repair are cut up
into soles for hospital slippers. Uniforms too badly
ripped for decent renovation are patched, dyed
grass-green, and issued to German prisoners.</p>

<p>There are some thousands of these prisoners,
with more coming. When they arrive, their prevailing
tint is grey. Their uniforms are grey, by
nature; their knee-high boots are grey, with dust;
their faces are grey, with exhaustion and grime.
These human derelicts are submitted to very
much the same process of restoration as the damaged
uniforms and equipment. They are paraded,
stripped, and marched into the first of a series of
renovation chambers. They pass under hot showers;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
they spend a salutary period in what is delicately
described as the “delousing chamber”; they
are then provided, first with underwear, then with
shoes, then with one of the grass-green uniforms
aforesaid, and finally with a cooking and toilet outfit.
They are shaved and their hair is cut; they
are medically examined; they are card-indexed; a
register is made of their trades; they are housed in
comfortable wooden huts within a great barbed-wire
enclosure; and within a few days they are at
work upon whatever tasks they happen to be best
qualified for, earning twenty centimes a day. They
are fed upon the rations of American and British
soldiers, including white bread—the only white
bread in Europe.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of them, before they came here,
saw the Allied prisoners in Germany—starved,
robbed, beaten, and forced to work in salt-mines
or shell-areas until death made an end of their
afflictions. These languishing grass-green captives
must bless the Geneva Convention, and marvel at
the uncultured folk who still stand by its provisions.</p>

<p>A camp of German prisoners practically runs
itself. Fritz knows when he is well off. There is no
insubordination. Men come rigidly to attention
when an officer passes. The routine work is supervised
by German sergeants. In this particular
camp you may enter one large hut and behold
some fifty German prisoners engaged upon clerical
work connected with camp administration—ration
indents, card-indexes, and the like. It is a
task after the German heart. Each prisoner is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
absorbed in his occupation. He can hardly bring
himself to rise to his feet when the door is thrown
open for the Officer of the Day, and <i lang="de">Achtung!</i>
is called. His pig’s eyes gleam contentedly behind
his spectacles. And well they may! A German delivered
from the German Army and permitted to
sit all day and make a card index of himself may
be excused for imagining that he has got as near
Heaven as a German is ever likely to get.</p>

<p>“When this War is over,” observes Mr. Joe
McCarthy, gazing meditatively through the
barbed wire, “I guess someb’dy will have to
chase these ducks back to Germany with a gun!”</p>

<p class="tb">Frenchwomen are not the only representatives
of their sex in the American Expeditionary Force.
There are hundreds of American women too, from
every walk of American life. There are the hospital
nurses, the stenographers, the telephone operators,
the motor-drivers—all duly enrolled members of
the Regular Service. Then there are the women of
the Auxiliary Forces—the Red Cross, and its
sister organizations—all doing a man’s share,
and something over. Their work is not supposed,
of course, to take them up into the battle zone.
They serve at the Base, or on Lines of Communication.
But in these days of Big Berthas and
promiscuous bombing raids, no one is safe. The
battle zone is the extent of ground which an
aeroplane can cover, as the inhabitants of London
know to their cost. Some of the worst devastation
in France may be witnessed at certain British hospital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
bases on the French coast, miles from any
battle-line.</p>

<p>Still, women have been known to find their way
into the Line. As some student of nature has told
us, “It is hard to keep a squirrel off the ground.”</p>

<p>One summer morning an old acquaintance of ours,
Miss Frances Lane, and her crony, or accomplice,
Miss Helen Ryker, came off night duty at their
hospital and sniffed the fresh air luxuriously.
They had twelve hours of complete freedom from
responsibility before them—a circumstance not
in itself calculated to correct Miss Lane’s natural
lightness of ballast.</p>

<p>In most hospitals nurses coming off night duty
are not unreasonably expected to spend at least
some portion of the following day in bed. But youthful
vitality, abetted by summer sunshine and a
martial atmosphere, make a formidable combination
against the forces of common sense. This
particular hospital was only thirty miles from the
Line. On still days the turmoil of the guns could
be heard quite plainly.</p>

<p>After breakfasting, Miss Lane took her friend
by the elbow and led her to the great military map
on the wall, with the position of the battle-line
clearly defined upon it by an irregular frontier
of red worsted, and said:</p>

<p>“Helen, listen! Just where are we on this little
old map?”</p>

<p>Miss Ryker, who possessed the unusual feminine
accomplishment of being able to read maps and
railroad time-tables, laid a slender finger-tip upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the blue chalk-mark which designated the geographical
position of the hospital.</p>

<p>“There,” she said.</p>

<p>“And,” pursued Miss Lane, in a low voice,
“<em>where do we go from here</em>?”</p>

<p>Miss Ryker, who was a girl of few words, began
to measure out distances with her finger and thumb.</p>

<p>“The nearest point to us,” she announced at
last, “is a place called Delficelles.”</p>

<p>“Delficelles? Our boys captured it not long ago,”
said Frances in confirmation. “I guess the
trenches must lie just beyond.”</p>

<p>On one point she was right: Delficelles had been
captured by an American Division a fortnight
previously. On the other she was wrong, for a
reason which will presently appear.</p>

<p>“We are going to visit them,” continued Miss
Lane.</p>

<p>“How do we get there?” enquired her practical
friend.</p>

<p>Miss Lane looked stealthily round, as a precaution
against eavesdroppers. Then she smiled
seraphically.</p>

<p>“I guess we can do it on our faces,” she remarked.</p>

<p class="tb">To get up into the Line—that tortured strip
of territory, some five miles wide, which winds
from the North Sea to the Alps, and within which
two solid walls of men have faced one another
for nearly four years—there are two recognized
courses of procedure. One is to be a member of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
armed party—an Infantry Battalion, say, going
up to take over a sector of trenches. There is no
doubting the <i lang="la">bona fides</i> of such an excursion.</p>

<p>The other course is incumbent upon solitary
individuals like despatch-riders and unchaperoned
civilians. These must have a much-signed and
countersigned pass. Even Staff Officers are not
exempt from this law. That lesson was learned as
far back as nineteen fourteen, when German officers,
arrayed in the uniform of the British General
Staff, kindly accompanied the British Army during
the retreat from Mons and added to the already
considerable difficulties of a hectic situation by
directing troops down wrong roads and issuing
orders of a demoralizing nature.</p>

<p>So now it is almost as difficult for an unauthorized
person to get into the fighting area as into
the Royal Yacht Squadron, or the New York
Subway at 6 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span> Mesdames Lane and Ryker
were obviously neither an armed party nor chaperoned
civilians. But young and attractive females
have means of attaining their ends which are
denied to the rest of creation. Ask not how the feat
was achieved. Enquire not the names of the susceptible
lorry-drivers who succumbed, nor of the
tall young military policeman at Dead Dog Corner
who melted incontinently beneath the appeal of
Miss Lane’s blue eyes. Let it suffice that by early
afternoon our two runagates found themselves
safely deposited in what was left of the village of
Delficelles. (By the way, the local soldiery pronounced
it “Dillpickle,” so we will let it go at that.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Having reached the haven of their desire, they
found, to their extreme satisfaction and relief,
that it seemed to be no part of any one’s duty to
turn them out. Indeed, such officers as they encountered
punctiliously saluted their uniform,
while the rank and file addressed friendly and
appreciative greetings to them. One enthusiast
produced a pocket camera, and insisted upon performing
a ceremony which he described as “spoiling
a film” upon the precious pair.</p>

<p>The village itself lay in a hollow behind a low
ridge, and was in what may be described as moderate
ruins. One learns to make these distinctions
in the shell-area. Roughly, there are three grades.
Villages whose roofs are riddled by shrapnel and
whose windows have ceased to exist, but whose
walls are still standing, may be regarded as practically
intact, and are much sought after as places
of residence. At the other end of the scale come the
villages which were deliberately obliterated by
Brother Boche during one of his great retreats.
There are many such in the neighbourhood of
Bapaume and Péronne. To-day not one stone of
these remains upon another. Not a tree is to be
seen. It is only by accepting the evidence of the
map that you are able to realize that you are in
a village at all. The main street runs between high
banks, overgrown by weeds and nettles. If you
part these and look underneath, you will find a
subsoil of brick rubble.</p>

<p>At the cross-roads in the centre, where once the
church stood, you will find a military sign-board<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
giving the map-reference of the village, followed
perhaps by a postscript, thus:</p>

<div class="bbox">

<p class="center">Z.17.c.25.</p>

<p class="center">THIS WAS</p>

<p class="center">VILLERS CARBONNEL</p>

</div>

<p><i lang="la">Fuit!</i></p>

<p>The village of Dillpickle occupied an intermediate
position between these two extremes.
Some of the houses were standing; others were
merely a pile of disintegrated bricks and mortar.
Where one of these ruins had overflowed into the
street and obstructed the fairway, the <i lang="fr">débris</i> had
been cleared away and built up into a neat wall,
guarding the sidewalk from further irruption.
Such houses as still stood were inhabited, chiefly
in the lower regions, by American artillerymen
and the Infantry Brigade in reserve. The village
was rich in German notice-boards—black stencilling
on plain wood—announcing that here was
the residence of the <i lang="de">Kommandant</i>, or here a shelter
from bombardment for so many <i lang="de">Männer</i>, or that
here it was <i lang="de">Verboten</i> for the common herd to go.
Most of these were now pasted over with notices
and orders in a different, and healthier, language.</p>

<p>Our friends collected a German notice-board
apiece as a souvenir, and proceeded to ransack
the village for further booty. Miss Ryker, who
was domestically minded, gleaned two forks, a
spoon, and some cups and saucers. Miss Lane,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
caring for none of these things, appropriated a
small mirror. Presently she announced:</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll go up to the trenches now,
Helen. They must be just over the hill, beyond
that wood on the sky-line.”</p>

<p>But Miss Lane, as already noted, was wrong.
The trenches did not lie just over the hill, for the
very good reason that there were no trenches. We
have grown so accustomed during this War to employing
“trenches” as a synonym for “battle-line”
that we are apt to overlook the fact that it is
possible to fight upon the surface of the earth. For
a long time both the Allies and the Hun suffered
from a disease called “Trenchitis,” induced by an
intensive experience of high explosive and machine-gun
bullets. If a force wished to defend itself, it
produced picks and shovels and dug itself in. If it
wished to attack, it dug an advanced “jumping-off”
trench in the dead of night, approached by
saps and tunnels, and so made the open space to be
covered in the assault as narrow as possible. This
is a useful and economical way of fighting, especially
when your troops are not sufficiently numerous
to warrant prodigality. But it wastes much
valuable time; and since the day when the entire
American Nation was placed at the disposal of the
Allies as a reinforcement, it has been found possible
to employ other methods. Down South, on the
Alsace-Lorraine front, where a lightly held outpost
line runs for more than a hundred miles toward
Belfort, trench warfare is still fashionable. But in
the Argonne, where most of the fighting takes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
place in closely wooded country, we remain more
or less above ground, maintaining touch with one
another as best we can by means of an irregular
chain of grass-pits or fortified shell-craters.</p>

<p>So when our pair of truants reached the wood on
the sky-line, and penetrated cautiously to the
other side, they beheld no trenches.</p>

<p>At their feet the road dropped steeply into a little
valley, filled with woods which ran right up the
slope beyond and disappeared into a smoky mist
on the opposite crest. The sun had not fulfilled its
early promise, and had disappeared by noon. A
small drizzling rain was beginning to fall.</p>

<p>Helen Ryker, who loved her personal comforts,
drew her blue cloak more closely round her, and
shivered.</p>

<p>“They don’t have any trenches <em>here</em>,” she announced,
in aggrieved tones.</p>

<p>“They are in the woods down in the valley,”
Miss Lane assured her. “You can hear the firing.”</p>

<p>You certainly could. Up to their ears from the
undergrowth on every side rose the mutterings of
warfare—solitary rifle-shots, and the intermittent
pup-pupping of machine guns. Down in the valley,
at the foot of the road, they could see a stream.
The road had once crossed it by a bridge; but the
bridge was now a ruin, and the road had been diverted
so as to cross higher up, by some sort of pontoon.</p>

<p>Not a human being was in sight. One of the
strangest characteristics of modern warfare—warfare
in which millions of men are employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
where formerly hundreds sufficed—is the entire
invisibility of the combatants. In these days of
aeroplanes and magnifying periscopes no man ever
makes himself more conspicuous than need be.
A hundred years ago soldiers went into action in
brightly coloured coats and flashing accoutrements.
Now their uniforms imitate the colours of
nature—the colours of grass and earth. Guns are
painted to look like logs of wood. If a sniper wishes
to do a little business from a tree-top or a thicket,
he not infrequently paints himself green as a preliminary.</p>

<p>“It’s lonesome here!” continued Miss Ryker.</p>

<p>“I expect we shall find the boys presently,” replied
the undefeated Frances. “My gracious,
Helen, what was that?”</p>

<p>Over their heads—quite close, it seemed—sailed
something invisible, with a weary sigh. It
was a howitzer shell fired from an American battery
five miles behind them. The sound of its passage
ceased, but almost directly afterward a column
of greenish-grey smoke spouted up from the
wooded hillside opposite, followed a few seconds
later by a heavy detonation.</p>

<p>Helen and Frances found themselves unaffectedly
gripping hands.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Helen tremulously.</p>

<p>One of Miss Lane’s most compelling characteristics
was that she was never at a loss for an answer.</p>

<p>“That? That’s artillery fire, I guess. That over
there is the smoke of a big gun.”</p>

<p>As usual, she was partially correct. What they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
saw and heard was, indeed, artillery fire, but it
was not the smoke of the gun, but the smoke of
the shell bursting among the German machine-gun
nests.</p>

<p>“German or American?” asked Helen.</p>

<p>“American, sure. Let’s go on down this road,
and see some more. It’s a nice quiet road. There
can’t be any danger.”</p>

<p>In the shell-area on the Western Front the fact
that a road is quiet does not by any means guarantee
that it is “nice.” But the people who really
enjoy war are those who have not been there before.
The pair of adventurers set boldly off down the hill.
As they started, a second contribution from the
howitzer battery passed over their heads, with the
lazy rustle which characterizes the descent of high-angle
shells, and burst in the woods opposite, fifty
yards to the right of the first.</p>

<p>“There’s another gun firing!” exclaimed Miss
Lane, clasping her hands rapturously. “My, but
I’m excited! C’m along, Helen!”</p>

<p>They hurried down the road, observing with a
pleasant thrill that the surface thereof was pitted
with shell-holes. More experienced fire-eaters would
have noted that some of these holes were of extremely
recent origin—a few hours old, in fact.
Once or twice they paused to collect more souvenirs—shell-fuses
and empty cartridge-cases.</p>

<p>Distances viewed across a valley are deceptive,
and their stroll down the road took longer than
they expected. The rain was coming down harder
than ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>“We ought to hit those trenches soon,” said Miss
Lane.</p>

<p>“What are trenches like, anyway?” enquired
Miss Ryker, a little peevishly. She was beginning to
make heavy weather of the expedition under her
cargo of crockery and expended ammunition.</p>

<p>Miss Lane, whose acquaintance with trench warfare
had been derived mainly from the Movies,
made no reply. She had stopped by the roadside to
read a notice-board, nailed to what was left of a
tree. It said:</p>

<p class="center"><i>This road must <span class="smcapuc">NOT</span> be used by troops during daylight.</i></p>

<p>She nodded her head sagely.</p>

<p>“That’s why there is no one around,” she remarked.
“What were you saying just now, Helen?”</p>

<p>Miss Ryker had discovered a fresh grievance.</p>

<p>“It seems to me that some of the firing has gotten
<em>behind</em> us!” she said.</p>

<p>The girls stood still, and listened. A third American
shell swung over their heads and burst in the
woods opposite. Simultaneously came a sharp outburst
of machine-gun fire from the right—the
right rear, in fact.</p>

<p>“Maybe we have walked into a sort of bend in
the line,” suggested Frances. “They call it a salient,”
she added professionally. “Why, if there
aren’t some of our boys at last! There … crossing
that bridge!”</p>

<p>She was right. As she spoke, two khaki-clad figures
emerged from the woods upon the opposite
side of the stream below them and trotted briskly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
across the pontoon bridge, in single file a few yards
apart. Once across, they joined forces, and began
to climb the hill in a more leisurely fashion. But it
was noticeable that instead of coming up the road
they kept a course roughly parallel to its direction—perhaps
a hundred yards away.</p>

<p>“Why should they go hiking through that mushy
long grass, wetting themselves, when there is a
good road right here? Aren’t men just <em>children</em>?”
observed Miss Ryker.</p>

<p>“Perhaps they don’t know about the road,” said
Miss Lane charitably, “We’ll call them. Oh—Boys!”</p>

<p>Her syren call had the desired effect—as well
it might. The gentlemen addressed, both of whom
were labouring up the slippery slope with bent
heads, stopped suddenly, and looked about them.
Next moment they were doubling heavily through
the long grass in the direction of the road, making
signals as they ran. They appeared agitated about
something.</p>

<p>“Come off that road!” shouted one of them, who
was leading by ten yards, to the two female figures
in the mist. “<i lang="fr">Quittez le chemin! C’est dangereux!</i>
Beat it for here! <i lang="fr">Dépêchez-vous!</i> As hard as you—well—I’ll—be—”
he swallowed something—“<em>Frances
Lane?</em>”</p>

<p>With a final bound, Boone Cruttenden, with a
steel helmet on his head, a gas apparatus slung on
his chest, and acute fear in his eyes, landed squarely
in the ditch; then scrambled out upon the road.</p>

<p>“Why—Boone?” began Frances affably. But,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
a grasp of iron fastened on her arm just above the
elbow, and a badly frightened young man proceeded
to propel her, without ceremony, across the
ditch and away from the road.</p>

<p>“You fetch the other one, Major!” he called
over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“I shall be charmed,” replied an unmistakable
English drawl.</p>

<p>“Boone, listen!” protested Miss Lane breathlessly,
as she was towed sideways across the hillside.
“What are you—?”</p>

<p>But her escort merely muttered to himself, as
they ran:</p>

<p>“Can you beat it? Can you <em>beat</em> it?”</p>

<p>Presently, having placed a distance of more than
a hundred yards between itself and the road, the
panting convoy was permitted to halt.</p>

<p>“We will now continue our excursion up the
hill,” announced the English Major. “But we will
keep off the road, if you ladies don’t object. It is
registered from top to bottom, you know.”</p>

<p>“Just what does that mean?” enquired Miss
Lane, whose natural curiosity was coming back
with her breath.</p>

<p>“It means,” replied the Major, removing a shining
monocle from his right eye and wiping it with
a khaki handkerchief, “that the Boche has the
range to every yard of it. As he usually searches
it with H.E. and shrapnel every few hours, it is
healthier to keep on the grass when going up and
down this hill. Are we far enough away now, do you
think, Cruttenden?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ye-es. But it would be better to split into two
parties, I should say. Less conspicuous—eh?”</p>

<p>The Major readjusted his monocle, and replied
solemnly:</p>

<p>“By all means. This young lady and I will extend
another hundred yards to the left. Cruttenden,
considering your tender years, you display a promising
acquaintance with tactics. Also diplomacy.
So long!”</p>

<p>So by force of tactical exigency, Frances Lane
and Boone Cruttenden walked up the hillside in
the rain together. Major Floyd and Miss Ryker
were discernible in the failing daylight, keeping
station on the left flank.</p>

<p>“Now, tell me!” Boone and Frances began together.
Then they stopped. Boone smiled.</p>

<p>“Ladies first!” he said.</p>

<p>But for once Frances preferred to be a listener.</p>

<p>“No, Boone Cruttenden—you!” she said. “Tell
me what you are doing here, anyway.”</p>

<p>“I got a chance,” explained Boone, “to come
here with Major Floyd—he’s our liaison officer
with the British Mission back of the line—and
have a look at this sector. The regiment may take
it over next month. The Major knows the ground,
and he took me down there”—he pointed backwards
over his shoulder—“to see our advanced
posts.”</p>

<p>“Where are the trenches?”</p>

<p>“Trenches? There are none. This is open warfare.
The Yanks and the Huns are mixed up together
in those woods, watching one another like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
cat and dog. We hold the stream, and some of the
ground beyond. That pontoon bridge is covered
by a concealed machine-gun post of ours, in case
the Hun tries to rush it. It’s probable he had
direct observation on it: that is why the Major
and I did not linger much as we came across.
We’re in a sort of pocket here. The German line
bends around us. Some of their posts up in the
woods have a clear view of the road, all the way up.
Luckily visibility is bad to-day, or you might have
been spotted. Now tell me what <em>you</em> are doing
here!”</p>

<p>Frances told him—as much as she thought
he need know.</p>

<p>“And where is your hospital located?” demanded
Boone.</p>

<p>Miss Lane informed him.</p>

<p>“That is more than thirty miles back!” cried
Boone.</p>

<p>“About that,” agreed Miss Lane meekly.</p>

<p>“Does any one know you are here?”</p>

<p>“I hope not! I mean, no one—except you,
Boone,” replied Frances softly.</p>

<p>The conscientious Boone made a last effort to
maintain a judicial attitude.</p>

<p>“Do you know you have committed a serious
military offence?” he demanded fiercely. “Trying
to get past sentries, and traffic police! Did
you know that no women are allowed anywhere in
the battle zone?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Miss Lane demurely. “That was
why we came—to break a record!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“And do you know that all this valley is liable to
be searched with gas, and you have no gas-mask?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know that,” confessed the delinquent,
“but I might have guessed it, I suppose. But I was
dead tired of that old hospital, Boone, and I was
just crazy to see the fighting!”</p>

<p>“Crazy? That’s just the word. You crazy,
crazy child!” said Boone affectionately. “Didn’t
you know the chances you were taking?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Frances Lane. “But”—her eyes
were raised to his for one devastating moment—“I
knew I was safe the moment I saw <em>you</em>, Boone!”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>Francie</em>!” murmured that utterly demoralized
youth.</p>

<p class="tb">“And where are your headquarters located,
Major?” enquired Miss Ryker brightly. The conversation
had harped so far upon her own misdemeanours,
and she was anxious to introduce a
fresh topic.</p>

<p>“I live chiefly with the Division holding this
sector,” replied Major Floyd. “I am liaison officer.”</p>

<p>“Don’t drop those cups. Just what does a
liaison officer do?”</p>

<p>“I act as bell-hop between the local British
Mission and the Americans. I go around paging
Generals and Staff Officers—and everything,”
replied the Major.</p>

<p>“There are no Generals here,” Miss Ryker
pointed out.</p>

<p>“No. To-day I am having a vacation. Boone
Cruttenden’s Division are in Corps Reserve near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
by, so I undertook to bring him up here and give
him his first view of the Line.”</p>

<p>“How did you get here?” enquired Miss Ryker,
who had not initiated the present conversation for
nothing.</p>

<p>“On a Staff car.”</p>

<p>“An automobile?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Where is it?”</p>

<p>“Behind that wood at the top of the hill.”</p>

<p>“Then,” announced Miss Ryker, coming to the
point, “you will be able to give us two poor girls
a ride home.”</p>

<p>“It’s—it’s twenty-five miles out of our way,”
said Floyd feebly. “Besides, Boone and I have our
reputations to consider. He is young, and might
live it down, but think of me! People would say
I was old enough to know better.”</p>

<p>“Think of <em>us</em>!” countered Miss Ryker; “if we
can’t get back, and the Matron finds that Frances
and I have been playing hookey!” She followed up
her appeal by a faint sob.</p>

<p>Major Floyd dropped the teacups and raised
his hands above his head.</p>

<p>“Kamerad!” he groaned.</p>

<p><em>Whoo-oo-oo-oo-UMP!</em></p>

<p>A long overdue shell from a German field battery
came shrieking over the tree-tops behind them
and landed squarely in the road, two hundred
yards to their right.</p>

<p>“You’re quite safe,” announced the Major,
patting four fingers which he had suddenly discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
on the sleeve of his Burberry. “That one
is too far away to hurt us. There will probably be
more, but Fritz won’t shell away from the road.
His imagination is not elastic.”</p>

<p>“What about Frances and Captain Cruttenden?”
said Helen. “They are nearer the road than we are.
Would that shell be able—?”</p>

<p>Major Floyd rubbed his misty monocle and
examined the two figures to his right.</p>

<p>“They don’t appear to have heard it,” he announced,
and shook his head mournfully.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_ELEVEN">CHAPTER ELEVEN<br />
<span class="smaller">THE LINE</span></h2>

<p>Most of us in our extreme youth, before we leave
home and adventure upon the Great Unknown of
school life—the most formidable ordeal, by the
way, that the majority of us ever have to face—endeavour
to prepare ourselves for what we imagine
lies before us by a course of study.</p>

<p>We devour stories about schools and schoolboys,
with an application most unusual in the young. We
have all the tenderfoot’s fear of being considered a
tenderfoot, so we take pains to acquire the schoolboy
tone; schoolboy atmosphere; schoolboy slang.
The exploits of the hero after he becomes “Cock
of the School”—whatever that may be—and
leads the football team to victory, are dismissed by
us as too lofty and distant for our achievement. We
are much more interested—more painfully interested—in
his experiences as a freshman or fag.
We endeavour to pick up tips as to what a boy
entering school for the first time should do, and
more particularly what he should not do, in order
to avoid being tossed in a blanket or sent to Coventry,
or labelled “sissy,” or “cry-baby”—and
all the other vague terrors which have kept prospective
Cocks of the School awake at night since
the dawn of Education.</p>

<p>This intensive course of self-preparation has one
drawback. None of the things described in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
books ever happen at the school to which we are
ultimately sent. We have plenty of surprises,
plenty of rough experiences; but none quite of the
kind anticipated.</p>

<p>American soldiers, arriving on the Western
Front in the fourth year of the War, feel themselves
in very much the same position as the self-conscious
adventurer described above.</p>

<p>Ever since—in some cases, before—our country
came in, we have been schooling ourselves for
the day when we should find ourselves Over Here,
among veteran soldiers. Methods have varied, of
course. Some of us have followed every turn of the
operations in official summaries and technical
articles. To such, the War has been a glorified
game, we will say, of scientific football. Others—Miss
Sissy Smithers, for instance—have educated
themselves upon more popular lines—from the
Sunday newspapers, or illustrated magazines of
the domestic variety, in which healthy patriotism
and “heart interest” are not fettered by any petty
considerations of technical possibility.</p>

<p>Over here, Disillusionment awaits both these
enthusiasts. The student of tactics soon realizes
the difference between fighting a battle in imagination
and in reality. Imagination cannot bring
home to any human brain the extent to which the
chess-board dispositions of modern strategy are
tempered by the actualities of modern fighting—in
other words, by the strain upon the human machine.
All the five senses are affected—hearing,
by the appalling din; seeing, by the spectacle of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
whole group of human beings blown to shreds;
smelling, by the reek of gas and explosives; touching,
by the feel of dead men’s faces everywhere
under your hand in the darkness; and tasting, by
the unforgettable flavour of meat in the mouth
after forty-eight hours’ continuous fighting in an
atmosphere of human blood. The War is going to
be won, not by the strategists, but by the man who
can endure these things most steadfastly.</p>

<p>Miss Sissy Smithers need not be taken so seriously.
He may be disappointed at first to find that
Red Cross nurses follow their calling in Base
Hospitals and not in No Man’s Land; and that
performing dogs, loaded with secret despatches
and medical comforts, are not such a prominent
feature of modern warfare as the lady novelist
would have us believe. But no enterprise, however
grim, was ever the worse for a touch of glamour.
Sissy will soon settle down.</p>

<p>Still, we have come to school knowing more than
most new boys—far more, indeed, than our seasoned
French and British companions knew when
they embarked upon their martial education. The
American soldier takes the field to-day, thanks to
the recorded experiences of others, with a serviceable
knowledge of the routine of trench warfare.
Gas is no surprise to him, and he is familiar with
the tactical handling of bombs, machine guns, and
trench-mortars.</p>

<p>Up to date, however, we have not by any means
drunk deep of warlike experience, for the good
reason that the authorities are breaking us in by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
degrees. We are now in trenches, holding what is
described as a quiet sector of the Line, recently
taken over from the French, and hitherto very
lightly held.</p>

<p>For the past two years, the Intelligence people
tell us, the trenches opposite have been manned
by only one German to every four yards of
front. Eddie Gillette has already announced that
when he has finished doing what he came out here
to do the number of Germans opposite may be the
same, but the method of distribution will be different.
“Not one Dutchman to four yards,” he explains,
“but a quarter of a Dutchman to every
one yard. Yes, <em>sir</em>!”</p>

<p>Every Army has its own system of conducting
trench warfare, founded largely upon national
characteristics. The Germans, it used to be said,
hold their trenches with machine guns, the British
with men, the French with artillery. Certainly in
nineteen-fifteen, when stationary warfare was the
order of the day upon the Western Front, the
Germans kept few men in the front trenches—except
perhaps at night—leaving the line very
much to the protection of barbed wire and machine
guns, the latter laid and trained in such a fashion as
to create if need be a continuous and impenetrable
horizontal lattice-work of bullets in front of every
section of the line. The British, having at that
time more men than munitions—a battalion was
lucky if it possessed four Vickers guns and a single
trench-mortar—filled their trenches with as many
defenders as they would hold, and trusted, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
altogether vainly, to the old British tradition of
rapid rifle fire and close work with the bayonet
to keep the line intact.</p>

<p>The French temperament called for more elasticity
than this. The one thing a Frenchman hates
to do in warfare is keep still. He prefers active
counter-measures to dogged resistance. So in
nineteen-fifteen, whenever a sector of the French
trenches was heavily bombarded, the garrison was
promptly withdrawn to a position of comparative
safety—where, the story goes, they seized the
opportunity to cook an extra-elaborate dinner.
If the Germans followed up their bombardment
with an infantry attack, that attack was met
mainly with an intensive barrage from that amazingly
rapid and accurate piece of scrap-iron, the
<i lang="fr">soixante-quinze</i> field gun. When the German attack
fizzled out, as it usually did, the incident ended,
and the French infantry returned to their place in
the line. But if it penetrated the barrage and occupied
the French trenches, the Frenchman finished
his coffee, adjusted Rosalie, his bayonet, and prized
Brother Boche out of his new quarters.</p>

<p>But all that was in nineteen-fifteen. In warfare
your best teacher is your opponent. Nowadays we
have, on each side of No Man’s Land, assimilated
one another’s methods. Moreover, trench warfare
of to-day has developed into a fluid affair. For one
thing, trench-mortars, tanks, and intensive artillery
bombardments can make hay of the most
elaborate defensive works. You can no longer surround
yourself with barbed wire and go comfortably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
to bed, secure in the knowledge that your
opponent cannot possibly get at you without a
long and laborious artillery preparation. In nineteen-sixteen,
before the First Battle of the Somme,
British and French guns pounded the German
trenches night and day for three weeks. It was a
great pounding, but it cannot be said that the subsequent
attack came as a surprise to the enemy.
Under such prolonged and pointed attentions even
a German is apt to suspect that something is in
the wind. But to-day we have other methods.
Three minutes of pandemonium from massed
trench-mortars—a rush of tanks—and your
defences are gone and the Philistine is upon you.</p>

<p>So in nineteen-eighteen we live perpetually upon
the <i lang="fr">qui vive</i>, and our methods have been elaborated
and standardized to the common measure of our
joint experience. Our artillery has the whole front
registered. At a given signal it can let down a barrage—a
Niagara of shrapnel and high-explosive—upon
the strip of earth that separates the
enemy’s front line from our own. This can be stationary,
to annihilate an enemy attack, or “creeping,”
to form a protective screen for an attack of
our own. We have machine guns too, set, <i lang="fr">à la</i>
Boche, at fixed angles to maintain a continuous
band of fire along each line of our trenches—more
especially along the second line; for it is a
waste of life and energy to-day to treat the front
trench as anything more than a close chain of outposts,
screening the real dispositions behind.</p>

<p>And the rifle and bayonet have come back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
their own. Two years ago they were in danger of
being discarded as obsolete. Every one was bomb
mad. It was claimed that a rifle and bayonet are
useless against an experienced opponent feeling
his way along a zigzag trench in your direction.
True; but a bomb is equally useless—or rather,
equally dangerous—in the presence of an opponent
rushing upon you in the open. So now we have
adjusted our perspectives, and each device of war
is put to its proper use.</p>

<p>So much for what the author of that little classic,
“Dere Mable,” would describe as “Tecknickle
stuff.”</p>

<p>Needless to say, we are burning to play with all
these new toys simultaneously, like a small boy on
Christmas morning. But we have had little opportunity
so far. To vary the metaphor, we must eat
up our bread and butter before we are allowed cake.
We are busy at present learning trench routine.
Taking over trenches from another unit, for instance.
This is a complicated and exasperating pastime.
It usually has to be performed in the dark;
otherwise enemy aeroplanes might observe unusual
activity behind our line, and advise their
artillery to that effect. This involves much night-marching
along roads pitted with shell-holes; and
the trouble about a shell-hole three feet deep is
that in wet weather it looks like a perfectly innocent
puddle. Frequently, to avoid congested wheel
traffic, we have to march across country in single
file, under the leadership of a faltering guide. Not
a light must be shown, not a word spoken. Each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
man, loaded with rifle, equipment, gas apparatus,
and a few extra and unauthorized comforts, has to
follow the ghostly form of the man immediately
in front of him. It is discouraging work, for the simple
reason that if you set one hundred men to
march in single file in the dark, though the leader
may be groping his way forward at the rate of
one mile per hour, the last man in the <i lang="fr">queue</i> is
always running, and <em>has</em> to run if he is not to be left
behind. No one knows why this should be so, but
the uncanny fact remains.</p>

<p>Once you have descended into the communication
trenches it is less easy to lose yourself—unless
the guide sets the example—but your progress
becomes slower than ever. Possibly—probably—you
meet a procession going in the opposite
direction—a ration-party, maybe, or stretcher-bearers
with their patient, cheery freight. The
fact that they have no right to be there at all—practically
all communication-trenches here are
supposed to be one-way thoroughfares—makes
matters no easier, though it affords relief in the
form of argumentative profanity as you struggle together
in the constricted fairway like stout matrons
loaded with market-produce in a street-car.</p>

<p>Arrived in the actual trenches, the congestion is
even greater, for now there are just twice as many
men in the trench as it was constructed to hold,
and the outgoing party must never budge until
the incoming party have arrived and “taken over.”
Taking over is no mere formality either. Officers,
machine-gunners, bombers, chemical experts, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
other specialists must seek out their “opposite
numbers” in the gross darkness and take receipt
in due form of ammunition, observation-posts,
gas-alarms, and situation reports, amid the crackling
of rifle-fire and the sputtering of the illuminating
flares.</p>

<p>At last the relief is complete. The word is passed
along. The outgoing unit, after communicating
sundry items of information as to the habits
and customs—mostly unpleasant—of the local
Boche, coupled with sundry warnings as to his
favourite targets and own tender spots, fades
away down the communication-trenches, with
whispered expressions of good-will—and you are
left alone, wondering what would happen if the
enemy were to make a surprise attack <em>now</em>.</p>

<p>Trench life is never comfortable at any time, but
the first night in a strange trench is the most
uncomfortable of all. For one thing, the trench
feels unnaturally crowded. Moreover, we are young
troops—the youngest troops in the world to-day—and
that means much. We have no Mulvaneys
or Learoyds among us. If we had, we should be
taught a number of things—how to boil a canteen
over a couple of glowing chips; how to hollow out
a bed in hard soil; where to find water in an apparently
dry trench—trifles small in themselves,
but making all the difference between misery and
comfort.</p>

<p>But that by the way. With daylight comes a new
spirit—or rather, the old spirit—of confidence.
Eager persons peer over the parapet, to observe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
where the enemy is, and what he is like. They see
little enough. Two hundred yards away an irregular
ripple of sandbags—some white, some black—looking
like a dirty wave-crest on a brown sea,
marks the position of the German fire-trenches.
This mixture of colours is thoughtful. If the sandbags
were all of one tint, like our own, loopholes
would be hard to conceal: under the German system,
you never know at a distance whether you
are looking at a loophole or merely a black sandbag.
The intervening space is a wilderness of shell-holes,
splintered tree-stumps, and rusty barbed wire.
Further observation is cut short by a sniper’s
bullet, which travels past enquiring heads with a
vicious crack. We have learned our first lesson.
In trench warfare, by daylight at least, curiosity
must be satisfied through peepholes or periscopes.</p>

<p>In the trench itself there is plenty to occupy us.
There are watches to be kept and manual work to
be done. A trench system is eternally throwing out
annexes and undergoing repairs, for the artillery
on the other side is always busy. There are supplies
to be brought up. There is cooking to be done: that
occupies much time, for firing-trenches to-day are
equipped, like the fashionable lady’s vanity-bag,
with everything except the kitchen stove. And no
bad thing either. Trench life has been described
by competent authorities as “Weeks of Monotony
tempered by Half-Hours of Hell.” Nothing dispels
monotony like the necessity of practising the primitive
domestic virtues. At home we hire expensive
menials—or expect our wives—to light our fires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
and cook our dinners, because we are too busy or
too civilized to do it ourselves. Over here we like
doing it, because it is our actual instinct to do so,
and also passes the time.</p>

<p>As for the Half-Hours of Hell, these mainly take
the form of short, furious bombardments and midnight
raids. But the German artillery is not very
busy in this sector. Guns, and more guns, are urgently
required farther north, where the Allied
line, after stretching back and back during those
anxious days in the spring of the year, has now
reacted like a released bowstring and has shot
the Boche back to the Meuse.</p>

<p>So far as we can gather from the sources at our
disposal—official bulletins, intermittent newspapers,
and trench gossip (personified in the American
Expeditionary Force by a supposititious individual
of great erudition but small reliability,
whose Christian name is “Joe”)—our cause is
prospering from the North Sea to the Alps. Germany
shot her bolt with her third great offensive
on the twenty-seventh of May, when German arms
once more crossed the Marne and penetrated to
within twenty-eight miles of Paris. There they were
stayed, in a battle where at least one third of the
Allied troops were American, and where the young
American Army got its first real chance, and took
it. In this operation the Second and Third American
Divisions were sent to stiffen the French line.
Of these, the Third successfully held a vital bridge-head
opposite Château Thierry: the Second captured
Bouresches, Belleau Wood, and Vaux.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>So much we know for certain, for these things
happened before we left England, and official
information was available. The work of the Marines,
in the Second Division, has already passed
into American history. But for news of subsequent
happenings we have had to depend too much upon
our friend Joe. All we know for certain is that on the
fifteenth of July the enemy launched just one more
offensive—his fourth and as it proved, his very
last. This time, so far as we can gather, the Allies,
instead of contenting themselves with defensive
tactics, took the business into their own hands and
bit suddenly and deeply into the side of the huge,
distended, pocketful of Germans which hung down
from Soissons over Paris. The pocket promptly
contracted itself: the enemy disgorged himself
from its mouth, and began to retreat. From all
accounts he has been retreating ever since.</p>

<p>French, British, and American troops were all
engaged in this, the final and triumphant redressing
of the balance. And each were represented by
their best. One of our liaison officers tells us of a
memorial set up by French soldiers in honour
of the dead of the famous Fifty-first Division of
the British Army—the Highland Territorials—and
of an inscription carved thereon which proclaimed
that hereafter the Thistle of Scotland
would forever flourish beside the Lilies of France.
In that great fight not merely unity of command,
but unity of sentiment, seem to have come to their
own at last.</p>

<p>The Allied counter-attack struck deep along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
whole line. Soissons and Montdidier, we hear, are
once more in our hands; while farther north, in
Flanders, the British Third and Fourth Armies
are sweeping forward for the last time in the blood-soaked
valley of the Lys.</p>

<p>As for the American share, we have not heard
too much, but what we have heard is enough to
make us tingle. We hear of great work by the
Regulars of the First, Second, and Third Divisions;
by the Twenty-sixth—the Yankees of New England—and
by the Forty-second Rainbow Division,
from Yaphank. It is also reported that other
American Divisions made no small impression
upon Brother Boche—the Fourth, the Twenty-eighth;
the Thirty-second, and the Seventy-seventh.</p>

<p>The Twenty-seventh and Thirtieth, we understand,
are somewhere with the British opposite
the Hindenburg Line near Cambrai. Doubtless
we shall hear something of them too, in due course.
Great days, great days! But to what a fever of
exasperation are we aroused, who are not there
ourselves!</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_TWELVE">CHAPTER TWELVE<br />
<span class="smaller">CHASING MONOTONY</span></h2>

<p>At present the authorities are engaged in impressing
upon us the truth of the maxim which says that
you must not run before you can walk. Our immediate
duty is to show that we can stand the test
of ordinary trench warfare.</p>

<p>First, such every-day nuisances as the German
sniper. And here we have a pleasant little success
to record.</p>

<p>When we took over these trenches, snipers were
numerous and vigilant. If you raised your head
above the parapet, one of two things happened.
Either you heard a sound like the crack of a whip-lash
close to your ear; or you did not. If you did,
you were lucky. If you did not, you were buried at
dusk.</p>

<p>There is one piece of slightly rising ground in the
enemy’s line which commands an oblique view
of a stretch of our front trenches. For a week we
have been pestered by a sniper concealed somewhere
along this eminence, about three hundred
yards away, on our right front. We have scrutinized
its whole expanse with periscopes and through
loopholes, but there is no sign of trench or emplacement
where the sniper might be concealed.</p>

<p>Yesterday that untutored but resourceful fire-eater,
Eddie Gillette, turned his attention to the
matter, the urgency of which had been impressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
upon him by the fact that a sniper’s bullet, travelling
sidewise down the trench, had chipped a
groove in Eddie’s own “tin derby” that very
morning, Eddie’s head being inside at the time.</p>

<p>“We got to locate that lobster,” he observed.
And he did.</p>

<p>In a field behind the support line there grows, or
rather, rots, a crop of derelict and much-bombarded
turnips. Last night Eddie, after a conference
with his officer, Boone Cruttenden, and the
top machine-gun sergeant, disappeared for an hour
into the <em>hinterland</em>, and brought back with him an
armful of selected esculents. The largest of these
he proceeded this morning to spear upon a flat lath
of wood. Upon the top of this eminence he perched
his own steel helmet, at a jaunty angle. Attended
by a respectfully interested cohort of disciples, or
rubbernecks, he next selected a suitable spot in
the front-line trench, and with the help of a length
of rope and a little ingenuity succeeded in lashing
the turnip-laden lath to the revetment of the parapet
in such a fashion as to make it possible to slide
the lath up and down.</p>

<p>It was a still, sunny, September morning, and
the whole line was quiet, except for an occasional
rifle-shot, and the intermittent boom of artillery
beyond the next hill-crest to the south. Eddie’s
preliminary adjustments were barely completed
when Boone Cruttenden arrived, carrying a periscope
and attended by the machine-gun sergeant.</p>

<p>“Got everything fixed, Gillette?” enquired
Boone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, <em>sir</em>,” replied Eddie, ignoring the cynical
smiles of Joe McCarthy, who was present in the
capacity of dramatic critic.</p>

<p>“Right,” said Boone. “Go to it!”</p>

<p>The inventor cautiously slid the lath up in its
groove, until the helmet-crowned turnip stood
some six inches above the parapet, offering a
goodly mark against the sky. Then crouching
down, he waited. The spectators, with remarkable
unanimity, followed his example.</p>

<p><em>Crack!</em></p>

<p>A bullet shaved the top sandbag and buried itself
with a vicious thud in the back wall of the trench.</p>

<p>“Missed!” announced Gillette calmly. “We
better let him try again.”</p>

<p>“Lower the turnip a couple of minutes first,”
advised Boone. “A real man wouldn’t keep his
head up there all the time—unless it was a bone
one!”</p>

<p>Gillette complied, and waited.</p>

<p>“What’s the big idea, Ed?” enquired Al
Thompson respectfully.</p>

<p>“The big idea,” replied Eddie, “is first of all to
let that Dutchman over there drill a hole in this
turnip. Then, if we peek through the hole, we shall
be looking along the track of the bullet—at this
range it would travel on a pretty-nigh flat line—and
we shall see the exact place the bullet started
from, which is what we are after. In case we don’t
get the exact location, we will put up another turnip
some other place in the trench, and get a cross-bearing
from that. That’s the big idea, boys!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“And who,” enquired the grating voice of Mr.
Joe McCarthy, “is the poor fish who’s gonna put
his bean up above the parapet and peek through
the hole?”</p>

<p>Eddie Gillette forbore to reply, but resumed his
operations with added dignity, sliding his turnip-head
once more into the enemy’s view. There
was another crack, and the steel helmet oscillated
sharply.</p>

<p>“Right through the nose!” announced Eddie,
with ghoulish satisfaction. “Now, Captain—quick!”</p>

<p>Already Boone Cruttenden, crouching low, was
applying his periscope to the hole in the back of
the turnip. The machine-gun sergeant, stationed
at a tiny observation loophole in a steel plate close
by, waited eagerly for instructions.</p>

<p>Boone, with his magnifying periscope, took a
rapid observation of the constricted field of view
afforded by the narrow tunnel through the turnip;
then another, over the open parapet this time;
then another, through the turnip again. He spoke
rapidly.</p>

<p>“Sergeant, do you see two stunted willows on the
sky-line, half-right?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Below them, a single small bush?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I got it.”</p>

<p>“Well, lay a machine gun to cover the ground
about five yards to the right of that. Call the range
three-fifty. I guess he is somewhere around there.
I can’t see any loophole or anything, but maybe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
he is lying right out in the open, covered in grass,
or—”</p>

<p><em>Crack!</em> The conscientious artist over the way was
growing restive at his own want of success. This
time he chipped the top of the steel helmet.</p>

<p>“That will do,” said Boone. “Lower away that
turnip, Gillette, and we’ll take a second bearing
farther along.”</p>

<p>Mr. Gillette collected his paraphernalia with the
solemn dignity of an acolyte taking part in a mystery.
But he unbent to human level for a moment.</p>

<p>“You see,” he observed caustically, “we don’t
require no poor fish here, Joe McCarthy!”</p>

<p>In due course a second turnip was hoisted and
perforated, a second bearing taken, and another
machine gun laid. The machine-gun teams took
station; the first cartridges were fed into the
chambers.</p>

<p>“Let ’em go the moment he snipes again,” was
Boone’s order.</p>

<p>A third spot was selected, and a third turnip
exposed. This time it wagged itself provokingly,
and the sniper responded at once. It was a beautiful
shot, but it was his last. Next moment two
converging streams of machine-gun bullets were
spattering his lair. What happened we shall never
know, but we were never again troubled from that
particular locality.</p>

<p>“We certainly got to hand it to you, Ed,” announced
Joe McCarthy, in an unusual fit of self-abasement.</p>

<p>Next, artillery fire. The Boche bombards our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
trenches twice a day, and searches the back areas
with shrapnel at night. He is not very persistent,
and a little sharp retaliation from our gunners
usually brings his performance to a conclusion.
Still, it is unpleasant while it lasts.</p>

<p>To be shelled for the first time must fairly rank
with the first cigarette, the first shave, and the first
kiss as one of the unforgettable experiences of life.
Opinions vary as to the best place to be during a
bombardment—assuming that one has to be anywhere
at all. Jim Nichols considers a shell-hole
a good place.</p>

<p>“It is well known,” he points out, “that no two
bullets ever hit the same spot. Nelson, or some
other historical gink, once said that the safest place
for a man to put his head during a sea-fight was
a hole made in a ship’s side by a cannon-ball. Me
for a shell-hole, every time!”</p>

<p>Boone Cruttenden thinks an ordinary trench
dugout would be best. Else what are dugouts for?</p>

<p>“It depends on who made them,” replies the
veteran Major Powers. “The German officer’s idea
is all right. He turns on a squad of men, and they
construct for him a combined club and restaurant
somewhere near the centre of the earth. But even
that is liable to have its exits blocked. Personally,
if I were under bombardment, I should stay out
in the trench. I am more likely to be hit, but less
likely to be buried; and I don’t intend to go putting
the cart before the horse at <em>my</em> funeral!”</p>

<p>All had an opportunity to test their theories—and
their nerve—the first afternoon after taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
over the trenches. Boone and Jim shared a dugout
in the front line, sunk below the forward parapet,
under the sandbags. Having contracted the British
habit of afternoon tea, they were occupied towards
five o’clock in brewing that beverage in a mess-tin,
when suddenly, with a whizz and a rush, a German
shell passed over the trench and burst amid a cloud
of flying clods fifty yards beyond it.</p>

<p>“This is the afternoon bombardment that we
were warned about,” said Jim, pouring out two cups
of tea. “Now we shall know whether we are shell-shy
or not!”</p>

<p>Boone took his aluminum teacup in his hand,
and held it to his lips. Simultaneously another shell
landed outside—fifty yards short of the parapet this
time. The earth shook. Fragments of dirt and grit
fell from the sandbag ceiling into the tea. Boone
regarded the hand which was holding the teacup.
He noted with secret satisfaction that though his
heart was bumping slightly, the hand was as steady
as a rock.</p>

<p>“That is what is known as ‘bracketing,’ I
guess,” said Nichols. “The next shell will strike an
average between the ranges of the first two and get
this happy home of ours just where the cork got
the bottle.”</p>

<p>He was right—or nearly. Next moment, with a
triumphant shriek, a shell landed fairly in the
trench, fifteen yards to their right. They felt little
concussion, for the trench was provided with stout
earthen traverses, which limited the radius of the
explosion and blanketed its force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>“The question before the House,” said Boone,
“is whether we stay where we are or go away from
here. Hallo, what’s that?”</p>

<p>A hoarse cry was passing down the trench from
mouth to mouth—a cry which never fails to tug
at a soldier’s heart, for he knows not what comrade
may be involved:</p>

<p>“Stretcher-bearers!”</p>

<p>Both officers scrambled out of their shelter.
Three men, crouching inside the entrance to a
neighbouring dugout, had been hit by fragments
of shell—all in the legs. In due course the stretchers
arrived, and the trio—our first actual casualties—were
borne off upon that long and tortuous
journey which starts in a communication-trench
and ends possibly at Home. They were followed
by the mingled chorus of sympathy and congratulation
always accorded in these days to those who
are taken, by those who are left.</p>

<p>More German shells arrived. The parapet was
hit in two places, and burst sandbags flew in the
air. But it was not “heavy stuff”—so the artillery
officer remarked, busy in his forward observing-station
with periscope and telephone—and the
actual damage was slight.</p>

<p>“I am calling for retaliation now,” he explained
to Boone and Jim. He gabbled a formula to the
telephone orderly, who repeated it into a portable
instrument before him. Presently the man looked
up.</p>

<p>“Battery fired!” he announced. And a few
moments later—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Whish!</em> <em>Whish!</em> <em>Whish!</em> <em>Whish!</em></p>

<p>Four hissing streaks of sound passed over the
trench from the rear. Next moment four heavy
detonations shook the earth. A hundred pairs of
eager eyes, peeping cautiously over the parapet,
observed four fountains of earth and smoke spring
up in No Man’s Land.</p>

<p>“Short!” muttered the gunner officer, and issued
a corrective order.</p>

<p>So the duel went on. It was a typical artillery
fight, in that each side endeavoured to dissuade its
opponent from further participation by bombarding,
not one another, but one another’s friends in
the trenches. The German fire did not slacken; if
anything it increased. Probably Brother Boche was
well aware that a fresh division had taken over the
line, and desired to make a good first impression.
But there were no more casualties.</p>

<p>“I’m tired of this. What about finishing our
tea?” enquired Boone Cruttenden of Jim Nichols.</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” said Jim. “Come on!”</p>

<p class="tb">But no. As they rounded the traverse leading
into their own particular bay, there came a roar
and a bang—and their home was not. When the
smoke cleared away they saw, instead of a rugged
and workmanlike parapet, a jumbled heap of disintegrated
sandbags and twisted timber-work.</p>

<p>Jim Nichols turned to his companion, with his
slow smile.</p>

<p>“There!” he said. “Do you still hold that the
best place during a bombardment is a dugout?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m stung, I admit,” said Boone. “But now
you can test <em>your</em> theory. You can sit in the middle
of that mess that the shell has made. It’s in full
view of the enemy, but of course you’ll be safe!”</p>

<p>The rival theorist smiled again.</p>

<p>“I confess I have died on that proposition,” he
said.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_THIRTEEN">CHAPTER THIRTEEN<br />
<span class="smaller">AN EXCURSION AND AN ALARUM</span></h2>

<p>We now regard ourselves, justifiably, as initiated.</p>

<p>We have been bombarded fairly regularly. We
do not like it, but we can stand it, which is all that
matters—as eels probably remark while being
skinned. We are getting used, also, to the sight of
sudden death and human blood. These things affect
us less than we expected. It is all a matter of environment.
If you were to see a man caught and cut
in two between a street-car and a taxi-cab in your
own home town, the spectacle would make you
physically sick and might haunt you for weeks,
because such incidents are not part of the recognized
routine of home town life. But here, they are
part of the day’s work: we are prepared for them:
they are what we are in the War for. And, curiously
and providentially, it seldom occurs to any
of us to suspect that it may be his turn next. Thus
all-wise Nature maintains our balance for us.</p>

<p>We have made another interesting discovery
about Nature, and that is that habit can be
stronger than instinct, and pride than either. The
first law of Nature is said to be the instinct of self-preservation.
Yet the average soldier, even in the
inferno of modern warfare, gives less trouble to his
leaders when under shell-fire than when his dinner
does not come up to the usual standard, or he has
run out of cigarettes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>Pride, again. This morning, two machine-gunners,
namely, one Sam Gates and our old friend
Miss Sissy Smithers, observed through their loophole
a derelict German helmet lying amid the hedge
of rusty barbed wire outside the trench. The passion
for souvenirs is inborn in the human race, but
most strongly developed in soldiers taking their first
turn in the trenches.</p>

<p>“Me for that lid!” announced Sissy.</p>

<p>“How are you gonna get it?” enquired his
friend.</p>

<p>“The only way I know of. Going over the top
and fetching it.”</p>

<p>Sam stared meditatively through the loophole,
and remarked carelessly:</p>

<p>“You’ll wait till it gets dark, I guess.”</p>

<p>Human nature is a curious thing. Sissy Smithers
was reckoned a quiet youth. In civil life he earned
a romantic but unheroic livelihood by selling ladies’
hosiery. But his friend’s perfectly casual and reasonable
observation stung him to the roots of his
being. His face flamed. Without a word he scrambled
upon the firing-step, heaved himself over the
parapet, walked quite deliberately to the barbed
wire, and brought back the helmet. The helmet
had a chip in it. The chip was made by a German
sniper as Sissy lifted the helmet out of the wire.</p>

<p>The Boche employs other vehicles of frightfulness
besides artillery. The Flying Pig, for example.
This engaging animal is really an aerial mine,
about six feet long. It appears suddenly high in
the air above No Man’s Land, propelled thither by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
some invisible and inaudible agency behind the
German line, and descends upon us in a series of
amusing somersaults. Having reached its destination
it explodes, with results disastrous to the
landscape. A single Flying Pig can do more damage
than a whole artillery bombardment. But it possesses
one redeeming feature. <em>You can see it coming.</em>
When you do, the correct procedure is to decide
quickly where it is going to come down, and then
go somewhere else. It is an exhilarating pastime,
but attended by complications when played by a
large number of persons in a narrow trench—especially
when differences of opinion exist as to
where the animal really intends to alight.</p>

<p>Then there is gas. But gas is more of a nuisance
than a danger in these days, since we are all—even
the horses—equipped with a special breathing
apparatus, and carry the same night and day. Our
newest mask, too, is a great advance on its predecessors.
The chief trouble about gas-masks hitherto has
been the formation of mist on the inside of the goggles.
Now, by the happy inspiration of some nameless
benefactor in the Service of Supply, the breathing
tubes are so arranged that the filtered air, when
it arrives, passes right over the inner surface of the
eye-pieces, clearing the glass at every intake of
breath.</p>

<p>Mustard gas is another story, because it attacks
the skin—unless you happen to be a coloured
gentleman, and then apparently you do not mind
so much.</p>

<p>But our busy time is at night. Supplies come up;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
casualties go back. Trench repairs have to be executed
in places inaccessible by daylight. Sandbags
innumerable have to be filled and set in position.</p>

<p>“This yer War,” observes Joe McCarthy, bitterly,
“will be finished when all the dirt in France
has been shovelled into sandbags—by you an’
me! Then they’ll have to quit, or fall through!”</p>

<p>But the most thrilling experiences of trench warfare
are trench raids. These are not necessarily
elaborate affairs. Some of them are quite informal.
Their objects are twofold—the first, to keep the
enemy guessing, the second, to obtain information.
The second is the most important. It is vitally
necessary to know just where every one of your
enemy’s Divisions is located. The simplest method
of finding out is to send over armed deputations
in the dead of night, with instructions to bring
back a few assorted Germans. These, when they
arrive, are interrogated, and their equipment and
shoulder-straps are examined, for clues as to their
identity. In this way it is usually possible to discover
what Divisions are in station opposite, and
how much front each holds. If a Division is spread
out widely, you may be tolerably sure that the
enemy has no serious designs upon your sector of
the line. But if Divisions are “distributed in
depth”—that is, with narrow fronts and long
tails—the wise commander begins to accumulate
ammunition and draft reserves into his back areas.
Before the great German drive in March, against
the attenuated British line at St. Quentin, Sir
Douglas Haig was made aware, by this and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
means, of the cheering intelligence that he had
opposite to a comparatively short sector of his
front sixty-four German Divisions—or six more
Divisions than there were British Divisions in the
whole of France and Belgium! That was a case in
which nothing could be done except put up the
best defence possible with the troops available, for
equally overwhelming odds were being massed
against the rest of the British line. But in normal
cases, to be forewarned is to be forearmed.</p>

<p>Trench raids are intermittent affairs. Patrols,
on the other hand, must be organized every night.
These excursions are not necessarily belligerent.
Their main object is to collect information, and to
make sure that the enemy keeps to his own side of
the street. If two patrols do meet, and feel constrained
to “start something,” the one thing no
one ever does is to pull a gun or throw a bomb.
To do so would be to invite impartial participation
in the game by the machine guns of both sides.
It must be cold steel or nothing. As often as not,
it is nothing. Two patrols may meet, and cut one
another dead, like rival beauties on Fifth Avenue.</p>

<p>One night Boone Cruttenden found himself detailed
for patrol duty, with a sergeant and four
men. The party were to scale the parapet, pass
through a gap in the wire, and make a tour of a
certain section of No Man’s Land. The whole operation,
which was by this time a familiar one, was
expected to occupy about an hour. Orders were
given to the trench garrison that there must be
no firing during this period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Just before midnight, in the soft September
darkness, Boone led his followers over the sandbags.
It was a quiet night—suspiciously quiet—and
there was little to be heard save some impatient
rips of machine-gun fire farther south, and the soft
explosion of the Verey pistols on both sides. There
are three impressions of nocturnal trench warfare
which never fade from the memory of those who
have served their apprenticeship therein—one, the
endless vista of bursting star-shells sinking from
the sky along that tortuous, dolorous way that calls
itself No Man’s Land; two, the eternal <em>plop-plop!</em>
of the Verey pistols; three, the mingled smell of
fresh earth, decaying matter, and disinfectants.</p>

<p>Boone’s first objective was a deep shell-crater
some fifteen yards outside the wire. He had discovered
it two nights previously, and it had struck
him as a useful location for an advanced patrolling
base. He gathered his henchmen around him and
addressed them in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Sergeant, you stay here with McCarthy. Gillette
and Thompson, crawl along our own front
in that direction”—he pointed south—“until
you come to the row of willow stumps that runs
across from our line to theirs. (It’s an old turnpike,
really.) Examine our wire all the way along, and
see if it has been monkeyed with. If you catch sight
of an enemy patrol, Gillette will stay and watch
while Thompson gets back here and reports to the
sergeant. Gillette, you will <em>not</em> take any notice of
them”—Eddie sighed brokenly—“unless they
show signs of wanting to come too close to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
trenches.” (Eddie’s spirits rose again.) “Then use
your own judgment. Your best plan will probably
be to get home by the shortest route and warn the
officer in charge. But don’t start any trouble if you
can help it, because I shall be over on the other
side with Gogarty, and we want to get home too!
In any case we must all be back in an hour, because
the artillery have a date with the German back
areas at two, and we don’t want to get mixed up
in any retaliation that may be going. Gogarty,
follow me up this dry ditch. It leads right to the
German wire, and we may find a German sentry-post
halfway across. So come quietly.”</p>

<p>The two little expeditions crept away, on routes
at right angles to one another. We will follow
Boone and Mr. James Gogarty, who has not hitherto
been introduced to the reader.</p>

<p>Jimmy Gogarty was twenty years of age, of
wizened appearance, and raucous voice. He looked
and sounded exactly like what he was—a bell-hop.
He had exchanged livery for uniform at the
first breath of hostilities, and was now reckoned
one of the smartest scouts in Boone’s Company.
He was a New Yorker born and bred, and had
fought his way steadily up the social ladder of
Second Avenue by the exercise of five remarkably
sharp wits and two unpleasantly hard fists. He
was devoted to Boone Cruttenden.</p>

<p>The trenches were about two hundred yards
apart. Progress along the ditch was not easy,
for it was choked with undergrowth and refuse.
Moreover, there were here and there unburied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Germans whom it were wiser to avoid. Occasionally
the ditch was intersected by other routes—old
trenches, and the like. Here they Stopped,
Looked, and Listened, as they had been warned
to do all their lives at more peaceful cross-roads
far away. But all was quiet. Too quiet, Boone
thought. On his previous excursions he had usually
been aware of much life—furtive, guttural,
inquisitive life—all around him. But to-night No
Man’s Land seemed a desert.</p>

<p>Boone whispered his suspicions to his squire.</p>

<p>“I guess dat means de bums is goin’ to start
somethin’,” observed Mr. Gogarty hoarsely. (He
was regrettably tough in his speech. The thin
veneer of hotel civilization had long been rubbed
off him.)</p>

<p>“We are fairly close to their wire now,” whispered
Boone. “I am going to get out of this drain
and prospect along their front. You go straight
ahead, and watch out in case they come crawling
down the ditch. If they do, give a whistle—just
one—to warn me, and then beat it for the Sergeant.
Otherwise, expect me here in ten minutes.”</p>

<p>“I get you,” said James agreeably.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the pair met in the appointed
spot. Boone was covered with mud and panting
heavily; Gogarty was quiescent, except that he was
emitting a peculiar noise. If he had been a cat, you
would have said he was purring.</p>

<p>“Seen anything?” asked Boone.</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>“Two Dutchmen! Dey was in dis ditch—’bout
thoity yards along. Keepin’ watch, I guess. <em>Some</em>
watch!”</p>

<p>“Where are they now?”</p>

<p>“Still there. Quite still—there!”</p>

<p>“You mean,—?”</p>

<p>“Well, I ain’t one to blow, but—I’m here, and
dey are not! You seen anything, Captain?”</p>

<p>“Yes; listen! There’s a German raiding-party,
or something, mustering outside their wire. I saw
them creeping into line, one by one, when the moon
came out just now. They are coming across, and
soon!”</p>

<p>“How are dey going to get through our wire?”
enquired practical James.</p>

<p>“Either break it up with a five-minute trench-mortar
bombardment, or creep forward and blow
a few gaps with dynamite torpedoes. Now, I am
going to wait here until they start moving. Then
I shall get back, quick. Meanwhile”—Boone
tugged at his field despatch-book—“I want you
to take a note to Major Powers.”</p>

<p>Flat on his stomach, Boone was squirming deep
into the rank undergrowth of the ditch.</p>

<p>“Hold this electric torch right down over the
paper,” he said, “while I write. Keep a good look-out
at the same time, and if you see any one,
switch it off.”</p>

<p>For two minutes Boone scribbled frantically.
The fighting blood of all the Cruttendens was
coursing in his veins. He forgot the official form of
address: he omitted certain prescribed formulæ—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
date, the hour, his own geographical position
but he overlooked nothing else. The despatch,
when completed, read:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Dear Major, the Hun is going to raid you. So far
as I can see it will be between the points A and B on
attached sketch. I suggest you send out a m.-g. to
shell-hole marked X, from which you can enfilade
whole front in danger. Come to shell-hole yourself, or
send some one, and I will come along and warn you
as soon as I see them start.</i></p>

</div>

<p>“Take that to Major Powers right away,” he
said. “As you pass through the shell-hole warn the
Sergeant, and tell him to expect a machine gun
there. But whatever you do, find the Major! Try
Battalion Headquarters first—in the support-line.
If he is not there, he’ll be in the firing-trench. But
find him, whatever you do, and quick!”</p>

<p>“I’ll find him,” replied the retired bell-hop, confidently.
“Why, I found people in the Biltmore
before now!”</p>

<p>He began to creep away.</p>

<p>“Come back here, of course,” added Boone.</p>

<p>Mr. Gogarty chuckled hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Cap,” he replied, “you betcher!”</p>

<p class="tb">Ten minutes passed. Boone, tingling like an induction
coil, watched the progress of the raiding-party.
They were moving very methodically, keeping
a beautiful line. Whenever a Verey light burst
above them, or the moon asserted herself, they
were flat on their faces in a moment; but during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the next period of darkness they always seemed
to cover another twenty yards. They were halfway
across now, almost exactly opposite to Boone.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/map.jpg" width="500" height="265" alt="Map of the trenches showing position of the raiding party" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>Another ten minutes. Still no Gogarty.</p>

<p>“I wonder where he is,” muttered Boone restlessly.
“We ought to have a watch on the far end
of this ditch. If they come creeping along it, as
they <em>ought</em> to do—Gee whizz!”</p>

<p>From behind the German line came a chorus of
sharp discharges; then a whirring and a humming
over Boone’s head. Then the earth rocked beneath
the tremendous detonation, and the skies were lit
up with the flash of a barrage of German trench-mortar
bombs, exploding along two hundred yards
of American wire.</p>

<p>The barrage lasted just one minute. Directly
after, three things happened, almost simultaneously.
The line of raiders rose to its feet and dashed
with a yell through the writhing remnants of the
wire. The voice of a machine gun—nay, a pair of
machine guns—broke into steady reverberation
from the shell-crater, seventy yards to Boone’s
right. Lastly, a rocket shot up from the American
support-line.</p>

<p>“That’s for our artillery,” said Boone to himself.
“They’ll be putting down a heavy barrage on No
Man’s Land in a moment—right here. Good-night,
nurse!”</p>

<p>He began to run swiftly back along the ditch,
crouching low. In this posture he rounded a slight
bend, and two steel helmets clashed together.
Boone, standing up to massage his ringing head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
realized that the faithful Gogarty had returned to
duty.</p>

<p>“We got dem guys fixed this time!” announced
the scout triumphantly. “<em>Two</em> Vickers guns in de
shell-hole, to give ’em hell comin’ and goin’!”</p>

<p>It was true. Major Powers had done marvels in
the twenty scant minutes at his disposal. He had
decided to send two machine guns over to the shell-hole;
for ammunition-belts sometimes jam, and it
was essential that a continuous stream of bullets
should be maintained along the wire during the
fateful moment of attack. He had also warned the
Artillery and Brigade Headquarters of impending
events. Finally, he had withdrawn his trench garrison
from the front line as a precaution against
a trench-mortar bombardment, and had aligned
them, with bayonets fixed, in the support-trench
behind, with orders to dash forward to their
original positions the moment the signal was given.</p>

<p>They were hasty preparations, but six weeks’
rehearsal could not have made their success more
complete. It was just such an undertaking as suits
the American soldier—without cohesion or direct
leadership, and depending almost entirely upon
quick grasp of the situation and spontaneous team-work.
The German attacking party, plunging
forward through the broken defences, came right
into line with the Vickers guns, with the result that
it found itself wading through a river of lead flowing
at the rate of five hundred bullets per minute
at a distance of eighteen inches from the ground.
Many went down at once: the others stumbled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
on gallantly enough, and reached the American
trench just in time to see a wave of yelling American
soldiers break into it from the ground behind.</p>

<p>Some of the raiders leapt down into the trench,
and were submerged at once. A few threw bombs,
most of which were deftly caught and thrown back
before they could explode. Others were engaged
upon the parapet itself. The rest, making heavy
weather in the wire and tortured by the stream of
bullets, broke back, only to find that the second
machine gun was maintaining a steady enfilade fire
across their line of retreat.</p>

<p>At the height of the turmoil the sky far behind
the American lines was suddenly illuminated by
flashes. Next moment, with a rush and a roar, the
American retaliatory barrage was tearing up No
Man’s Land and the German fire-trenches beyond.
The raiders were completely isolated.</p>

<p>For four minutes the tempest of shells raged.
Then, with stunning suddenness, came silence,
grim as death, broken only by a few hoarse cries
and a little sympathetic uneasiness farther down
the line. The raid was over. How it had fared the
Germans over the way never knew, for not a single
raider came back to tell them.</p>

<p>The dead and wounded enemy were disentangled
from the wire, where most of them had fallen.
American casualties, thanks to Boone’s warning
and Major Powers’s dispositions, had been comparatively
slight, though the bombs had taken a
certain gruesome toll. Eddie Gillette, who with
Al Thompson had returned from his tour of inspection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
just in time to take part in the defence of
the trench, was suffering from abraded knuckles,
due to an encounter with a set of Teutonic teeth.
Otherwise, none of our particular friends had received
a scratch, though Boone and Gogarty had
escaped their own artillery barrage by four seconds.</p>

<p>An hour later the life of the line had reverted
once more from Hell to Monotony. A working-party
was out in front, repairing wire and replacing
sandbags. Patrols were out again, in case the enemy
should feel disposed to throw good money after
bad. The artillery stood to, prepared to resume
the argument if need be. But not a German gun
cheeped all night. Possibly they were surprised
about something.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a string of prisoners was filing back
to Regimental Headquarters, down a communication-trench—or
<i lang="fr">boyau</i>, to employ the expressive
phrase of its Gallic constructors—muddy, dishevelled,
and sulky. German prisoners in these
days are not usually sulky: most of them are
frankly delighted to be counted out of the War.
But this particular consignment were distinguished,
under their grime, by a certain peculiar
and awful air of outraged majesty.</p>

<p>On arrival at Headquarters the mystery was
revealed. An American Staff Officer, an expert
linguist, took charge of the party, and issued the
usual orders.</p>

<p>“Sergeant, find out if there are any officers among
them, and put them by themselves. Then search
the others.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>He was answered—in tolerable English—by
a lanky youth who stood at the end of the long line
of prisoners.</p>

<p>“We are <em>all</em> officers!” he announced, with dignity.</p>

<p>It was a simple enough explanation, really. This
was no common or vulgar raiding-party. It was a
junior officers’ Instruction Class, sent over to gain
a little experience and confidence in the delicate
art of trench-raiding on this “quiet sector of the
line.” It was a genuine and painful shock to them
to find that the line was held by the Americans
in force—the Americans, who, according to the
Great General Staff at Headquarters, were still
at home, chasing buffaloes down Broadway. Too
bad!</p>

<p class="tb">But already these small diversions are swept
into the limbo of the Things that do not Matter.
Word has just come that our period of trench warfare
is over, and that we are to proceed to the
Argonne, to take part in the Great Offensive.</p>

<p>Evidently some one at the top has decided that
this War has gone on long enough.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_FOURTEEN">CHAPTER FOURTEEN<br />
<span class="smaller">THE FOREST OF THE ARGONNE</span></h2>

<p>During the past fortnight we have been learning
the difference between Warfare of Position and
Warfare of Movement, and we are very, very tired.
Moreover, the end of our labour is not yet. But
we have made good. The Divisional General himself
has informed us of the fact, in an official Order.
So has the enemy, in an even more flattering fashion.
He has fallen back—steadily and stubbornly—but
back.</p>

<p>The fighting began more than a fortnight ago.
But first of all we had to get to the scene of action.
That involved endless marches, through undulating,
heavily wooded, exhausting country. It is the
fall of the year. Rain is abundant, roads are not
too numerous, and these are packed from end to
end with traffic so close that it is sometimes impossible
for a vehicle to find turning-space in ten
miles.</p>

<p>These roads, though well constructed and constantly
reënforced, are none too good. They were
never built to carry such traffic as this, and since
the inevitable ditch on either side deprives them
of lateral support, the effect of a constant stream
of monstrously heavy vehicles upon the surface of
one of them is that of a rolling-pin upon a strip of
dough—it makes it wider. Not only wider, but
thinner; for the edges of the road are squeezed out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
into the ditch, and the whole fabric loses cohesion.
Almost anywhere, but in particular near the sides,
a wheel is apt suddenly to find a soft spot and sink
up to the axle, with consequent congestion and
tumult.</p>

<p>It is a double tide of traffic. Both streams are
made up of similar constituents, with certain
necessary contrasts. There are bodies of infantry,
either going up into action or else coming out.
There is no mistaking the latter. Their uniforms
are splashed, their faces are caked, and their eyes
are red for lack of sleep. They are obviously “all
in,” but they hobble manfully along, with the comfortable
satisfaction of men who have left behind
them a task well and truly performed. They exchange
ironic greetings with the full-fed, boisterous
bands of adventurers whom they encounter hastening
in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Ambulances, again. Those going forward are
empty and trim: those returning are travel-stained
and crowded. It is rumoured that the American
Army has suffered over a hundred thousand casualties
during the past few weeks. The fighting in
the Argonne Forest has been terrific. Grandpré,
through which we expect to pass, has been taken
and lost half a dozen times. Each of the ambulances
carries a full complement of stretcher-cases; and
usually beside the driver sits a gaunt, miry statue
with his arm in a sling, or a blood-soaked rag about
his head. Occasionally, too, there occurs a civilian
farm-wagon, containing a dozen or so less serious
cases, with tickets tied to their buttons, on their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
way to an Evacuation Station. There are also
women and children passengers; for the battle
zone is extending daily, and it is needful, from
sheer humanity, to remove the civil population to
safer ground. On the box-seat of one of these wagons
sits a small French boy. Perhaps he is eight
years old. He is easily the proudest and happiest
person in all this dolorous procession, for his right
wrist is swathed in a slightly encrimsoned bandage,
gloriously conspicuous.</p>

<p>Then there are motor wagons, also full. Those
going up contain ammunition, barbed wire, galvanized
iron sheeting, engineering material, or
rations. Those returning are heaped with salvage
of every kind—furniture, the property of the refugees;
battlefield <i lang="fr">dèbris</i>, and, wherever an available
chink presents itself, men—footsore men, stragglers,
or regular working-parties. The latter are
usually coloured, and, with steel helmets balanced
at every angle upon their woolly pates, smile upon
the seething activity beneath them with the simple
enjoyment of a child at its first circus.</p>

<p>These wagons—or camions—are of two types.
There are big Thorneycroft lorries, holding three
tons and made in England, and smaller vehicles of
American design, known as “Quads.” These possess
the unusual feature of a drive upon either axle;
so that if your rear wheels slip backwards into a
ditch or quagmire, your front wheels will continue
to function and will extricate you in no time.
Heaven knows how these contraptions are steered,
but steered they are, and with remarkable skill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>Then there are guns—and more guns. These
are mainly French seventy-fives and hundred-and-fifty-fives,
with American gun teams. Those going
up are workmanlike, but inconspicuous. They are
newly painted with the usual red, green, and yellow
splashes. The fishing-nets which will be spread
above them when they get into action, intersticed
with grass, leaves, and twigs, are at present neatly
furled and lashed along the barrels. The gunners
sprawl anywhere but upon their hard little iron
seats. The guns coming out look different. All are
plastered with mud; some are on the casualty list,
and are being towed upon trolleys by fussy little
traction engines.</p>

<p>Here and there in the procession wallow British
tanks. These are either “Heavies,” weighing nearly
thirty tons and carrying a crew of seven or eight,
or “Whippets,” which only require three men and
can move at the rate of twelve miles an hour.</p>

<p>The tank is the humourist of this unhumorous
War. Its method of joining a close-packed procession
of road traffic is characteristic. It appears
suddenly out of a wood in a field beside the road,
obliterates thirty yards of a hedge, squeezes a
ditch flat, and insinuates itself sideways, with
jolly <em>abandon</em>, into that part of the procession
which happens to be passing at the moment—the
whole in a manner reminiscent of that heavy-footed
and determined individual who is accustomed
by similar tactics to secure for himself a
good place in the queue outside a movie pay-box.
On the other hand, should you be ditched or disabled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
in any way, to your own discomfort and the
congestion of traffic, a tank is always willing to
swing good-humouredly out of the line, scramble
across country for a field or so, lurch heavily into
the roadway again, harness itself to a tow-rope,
and extract you from your present predicament as
easily and as suddenly as a mastodon might extract
a cork from a bottle.</p>

<p>Certainly our march gave us a comprehensive
view of the ingredients of modern warfare. American
soldiers, white and black—mostly cheerful;
French refugees—all sad. Guns, limbers, camions,
carts, ambulances, tanks—all moving in an endless,
tumultuous, profane stream. At cross-roads,
traffic policeman struggling manfully with an impossible
job. Automobiles everywhere—Cadillacs,
Fords, and Dodges—all trying to make openings
and steal a march upon the rest of Creation. Above
us, the sky of France, weeping for her lost children.
Around us, the undulating, rain-blurred hillsides
of the Argonne Forest. Beneath our feet, Mud,
Mud, Mud.</p>

<p>Day after day we tramped—through Toul, the
northwest corner of the great rectangle of French
soil which has been an American military colony
since the summer of nineteen-seventeen; across
the trench lines of the old days of stationary warfare,
where Frenchmen faced the Boches for three
long years. American troops have fought there too.
Here, in what was once No Man’s Land, stand
the ruins of Seicheprey, famed as having been
the scene of the first clash between American and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
German troops. (It was a raid, and we lost our
first prisoners there. Well, we have plenty of Germans
now to barter for them, when the time comes—and
then some!) Then on past Montfaucon, the
Crown Prince’s headquarters at the Battle of
Verdun, now an American stronghold; through
miles and miles of devastated country, with here
and there a little American graveyard (to which
we pay due reverence), to Grandpré. This is a mere
fragment of a village, clinging to the face of a rock
looking south, and is shelled out of recognition.
Then on, through the Bois des Loges, following the
tide of victory northward, towards Mézières and
Sedan. Somewhere to our right lies Verdun, garrisoned
by American soldiers—all, that is, save
the Citadel, a wondrous Gibraltar dug into the
interior of a hill, containing miles of illuminated
passageways; barracks, a bakery, an arsenal, a
chapel, a theatre. Here the French maintain their
own garrison—and maybe their own secrets.
Secrets or no, it was that Citadel and that garrison
which broke the back of the German assault in the
critical days of nineteen-sixteen.</p>

<p>Somewhere on our left marches the Army of the
French General Gouraud, keeping pace with our
own in the great enveloping movement of which
our attack forms the extreme right.</p>

<p class="tb">And there we were sent into the battle. It being
our first, our impressions are somewhat confused.
In theory, our own particular part in the enterprise
was a simple one. A wood lay upon our front, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
we were ordered to capture it. And we did so—all
save the far edge. But at a price. When our
barrage lifted in the early dawn, and we dashed
forward to the assault which we had rehearsed
so often, our consciousness was mainly of barbed
wire and machine-gun bullets. These were in unholy
alliance everywhere, and took grievous toll.
Buck Stamper, the biggest man in the Battalion,
was the first one to go down. He was shot in the
legs, and another bullet passed through his heart
as he struggled forward, crippled but game, on his
hands and knees. But a hundred men had seen him
die, and the gun which had knocked him out was
in their hands three minutes later. Still, formations
were broken up, communication with the rear was
cut, and the brunt of the battle began to fall upon
the individual. Now it is as an individual fighter
that the American soldier excels. He has his faults.
To-day attacks have to be carefully rehearsed;
battles are fought on a strict time-table. The eager
young fighter is too apt to jump off the mark before
the signal is given, and overrun his objective when
he reaches it. This gets him into trouble with his
best friend, the Gunner; for under these circumstances
the latter must either forbear to fire or else
risk hitting his own Infantry. But it is a fault on
the right side, and is soon corrected by painful
experience. On the other hand, it develops in its
owner that most priceless quality of the soldier,
initiative. Some of the finest work in this War has
been accomplished by small bodies of troops—particularly
British and American—working forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
under a young officer, or a sergeant, or very
often under no leader at all, to the capture of some
vital point long after they have lost touch with the
directing force behind.</p>

<p>The upshot of it all was that after a week of
hand-to-hand fighting and bloody murder we
cleared the tenacious Hun right out of the wood—at
this point more than a mile thick—leaving him
possessed of nothing but the far edge. We are terribly
exhausted, and our losses do not bear thinking
of; but we have begged, before we are withdrawn,
to be permitted to capture that far edge and consolidate
the whole position. Our prayer has been
granted. We attack to-morrow, refreshed by a lull
of four days.</p>

<p>“And,” observed Colonel Graham to his assembled
officers, “if we Americans on the right can
do our part, and swing our horn of the line clear
around through Metz and Sedan, we shall have the
whole German Army in a pocket. And then—may
the Lord have mercy on them, for we will
not!”</p>

<p>Colonel Graham is a comparatively new arrival
among us, but we are children in his sight when
it comes to experience of actual fighting. Our own
commander has gone home sick, and Colonel
Graham reigns in his stead. He is a regular of the
old school. Soldiering is the breath of his nostrils,
and the Army is his father and mother. He has
been over here more than twelve months, and has
seen much service with our Allies farther north.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Behold him in his headquarters, lately the property
of some German gentlemen compelled for
business reasons to move farther east—thick-set,
hard as nails, and twinkling humorously through
his spectacles upon his battle-stained disciples.
Most of our friends are present—but not all.
Jim Nichols is there; so is Major Floyd, who has no
particular call to be there at all, for we are within
a few hundred yards of the German front line, and
we are to attack at dawn. It is now nearly four
o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p>Another transient visitor is present—a young
officer of the Air Service, by name Harvey Blane.
His present duty is to maintain connection between
the forces on the ground and the forces of the air.
He has come into the line to-night in order to inform
the Colonel of the arrangements concluded
between the Artillery and the aeroplanes for the
protection of the Infantry in the coming attack.
Aviators do not vary much as a class. They are all
incredibly young; they are all endowed with the
undefinable but clear-cut individuality which comes
to earth-dwellers who have learned to maintain
themselves in some other element—sailors possess
it in similar degree—and they are all intensely
reticent in the presence of laymen about their experiences
in the air. Such an one was young Harvey
Blane.</p>

<p>There was a full muster of officers in the crowded
dugout, for the Colonel was outlining the morrow’s
operations, and pencils were busy. But Major
Powers, that wise and kindly Ulysses, was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
there. He was lying in one of a cluster of newly made
American graves at the back of the wood which
he had helped to capture.</p>

<p>Neither was Boone Cruttenden.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_FIFTEEN">CHAPTER FIFTEEN<br />
<span class="smaller">THE ELEVENTH HOUR</span></h2>

<p>The Colonel was speaking.</p>

<p>“Now listen to what the Intelligence Report has
to say about the enemy’s defensive arrangements.</p>

<p>“<i>The road leading into the Wood on the west side
is said to be furnished with tank traps.</i> Well, we
don’t have any tanks to-day, so we should worry
about that. (By the way, boys, remind me to tell
you a story afterwards about a tank.) <i>All indications
point to the fact that the enemy battalion occupying
the north side of Lapin Wood</i>—that’s where we
are now—<i>has received orders to hold the position to
the last.</i> Well, the last will come, we hope, about
five-fifteen this morning. <i>When dislodged, it is probable
that the enemy will fall back nearly two kilometres,
in order to occupy prepared positions on a newly
constructed line south of the village of Ventreuil.</i> That
need not worry us, because we shall be relieved as
soon as we fire him out of here.… Now for machine
guns! <i>Nine machine guns have been located
between points A and B on the northern edge of Lapin
Wood-</i>-that is delightful—<i>distributed as follows</i>—Company
Officers, get these down on your
maps.… <i>Wire.</i> H’m-m-m! <i>Three lines interwoven
in the trees on north side of wood, at distance of three
metres.</i> Well, wire is the business of the Trench
Mortar folks. <i>Trenches. Enemy’s fire-trenches are
situated along northern edge of wood.</i> We have noticed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
them! <i>Elements of trenches are visible on open
ground behind, at points.…</i> Take this down, please.… <i>Miscellaneous.
Bois des Loups. Flashes have
been observed in this wood.</i> They certainly have!
<i>Careful observation of the angle of fall and sound-ranging
reports lead to the conclusion that there are at
least three batteries of Seventy-sevens there, together
with two or three heavy mortars.</i> Well, I guess our
Artillery will take care of <em>that</em>.”</p>

<p>The Colonel looked up from the Report and
wiped his spectacles, which had grown dim in the
humid atmosphere of the dugout.</p>

<p>“Machine guns will be our chief snag, I guess,”
he observed. “Talking of machine guns, just how
badly was Boone Cruttenden hit last week?”</p>

<p>“Shrapnel in the right shoulder, sir,” replied
Jim Nichols. “Not very serious, I believe.”</p>

<p>“He was gotten away all right, I hope?”</p>

<p>“Yes. His own men brought him back.”</p>

<p>“He did a fine piece of work,” said the Colonel.
“But I want the names of <em>all</em> concerned, for citation.
How did Boone and his bunch manage to get into
that machine-gun nest at all? I have had no time
to go through the official report yet. Did he creep
around behind and catch them napping, or what?”</p>

<p>“Partly that, sir. But what helped most was the
action of a single enlisted man. We were lying in
a belt of trees. A clearing lay between us and the
German line, which was less than two hundred
yards away. The machine-gun nest was on our left
front, and commanded the clearing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I get that. Go on!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“Boone and his party,” continued Jim, “had
been gone about twenty minutes on their detour
through the undergrowth which was to cut out this
nest. We were lying along the edge of the clearing,
ready to make a supporting bayonet rush if Boone
got in among them. At what I thought was the
right moment I passed the word down the line for
the men to be ready. And then—and then—”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“And then, sir, the <em>darndest</em> thing you ever
saw!” proclaimed Jim, breaking away from strict
technicalities in his emotion. “One of my men
jumped suddenly to his feet and charged out into
the middle of the clearing. He had a little flag—our
flag—on the end of his bayonet, and he acted
like he was stark insane.”</p>

<p>“Who was the man?”</p>

<p>“His name was Smithers. Miss Sissy Smithers,
the boys called him. He was a sissy, in his ways,
usually.”</p>

<p>“And what did he do?”</p>

<p>“He stood there shouting to the enemy to come
out and fight. He yelled,—‘I see you, you Dutchmen!
You Squareheads! You Slobs! Look at me!
Look at this li’l old Flag! Fire on that if you dare!’
Then he held his rifle up high, with the Stars and
Stripes on the end of it.”</p>

<p>There ran a sudden thrill around the crowded
table. The American venerates his Flag in a fashion
hardly comprehended by the Englishman. Every
nation must worship some totem. In the Englishman
this impulse finds vent in loyalty to the Crown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
We love the Union Jack, and we salute it upon
state occasions. But we take off our hats to the
King, and pray God to save him, because he stands
for a tradition that goes right back a thousand
years and more. The American pins everything—national
honor, national tradition, personal loyalty,
everything—to Old Glory.</p>

<p>“Well?” enquired the Colonel—presently.</p>

<p>“For a moment,” pursued Nichols, “the enemy
did nothing. He was kind of paralyzed, I guess.
Then the machine guns in that nest spoke up, and
poor Smithers went down. Even then he was only
hit in the legs. He sat up, and waved his flag again.
Then they got him in the body, and he fell on his
back. But he managed to keep his rifle erect for
another fifteen seconds or so. He shouted, too, as
he lay—calling them cowards, and daring them
to come and take the Flag. By that time the guns
were trained right on him, and—he passed out.
But”—Nichols’s voice rose again exultantly—“they
had been so busy trying to fix poor Sissy
that they never thought to look around behind
them; and right then Boone and his bunch jumped
in on their necks, and the nest was out of business
for keeps! We went across with the supporting
party and helped them clean up. Turned their own
machine guns on them too, until a German field
battery got to work on us.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that was when you got most of your
casualties?” said the Colonel.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Two men killed, besides Smithers, and
Boone and seven others wounded. The men were all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
fine. After the shelling died down at dusk, and we
were settling into our new positions, two or three
Huns who knew a little English started to josh us;
explained how they were coming over presently to
turn us out, and beat us up, and show themselves
a time generally. Finally one of our men, called
McCarthy, pushed his head over the sandbags, and
yelled: ‘Aw, what’s the use of pulling that stuff?
Is this a War, or a Chautauqua?’ That fixed them.
I guess McCarthy had stepped right outside their
vocabulary!”</p>

<p>“Great boys, great boys!” chuckled the Colonel.
“They were just the same on the Hindenburg
Line.” He turned to Floyd. “Our idioms there puzzled
some of our British friends, Major. But between
us we got the goods on old man Hindenburg,
I fancy.”</p>

<p>“I have heard rumours to that effect, Colonel,”
replied Floyd. “The coöperation was pretty good,
eh?”</p>

<p>“It was great,” said the Colonel. “French, British,
or American, it did not seem to matter who
was in command. We all kept touch, and we all
made our objectives. And team-work! Here is a
letter I received from an Australian commander
under whom we worked for quite a while. He was
a busy man, but he found time to write me this.”</p>

<p>The Colonel produced a frayed field-despatch
from the breast pocket of his tunic, and read:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>I desire to take the opportunity of tendering to you, as
their immediate commander, my earnest thanks for the
assistance and service of the four companies of Infantry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
who participated in yesterday’s brilliant operations. The
dash, gallantry, and efficiency of these American troops
left nothing to be desired, and my Australian soldiers speak
in the very highest terms in praise of them.</i></p>

</div>

<p>“There is some more,” added the Colonel, “but
that will be sufficient to show you what that General
thought of my boys. The Australians have a
pretty high standard of their own, and they don’t
pin orchids on other people unnecessarily. So we
appreciated <em>this</em>.” He tapped the despatch. “The
fact is, we were a band of brothers. The only occasion
upon which we indulged in anything like ceremony
or company manners was on the Fourteenth
of July. (Corresponds to our Fourth.) I went along
with a few others to represent the Americans at a
swell lunch which was to be given in the Town Hall
of Amiens in honor of the occasion. Amiens was
under shell-fire at the time—right in view of the
enemy, who were up on the high ground back of
Villers Brettoneux, not ten miles away. But no one
worried. We had our lunch in a cellar—French,
British, Australian, and American officers. Some
lunch! There were flowers on the table, too. <em>Flowers!</em>
God knows where they came from. But that’s
France—just France! They had to have them!
Speeches, too, by Senators from Paris. <em>Speeches</em>,
with German shells bursting in the street outside!
They’re a great nation!”</p>

<p>“How did the British Tommy and the Doughboy
get along?” inquired Floyd.</p>

<p>Colonel Graham’s frosty eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>“Each took a little while,” he said, “to get the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
combination of the other. You see, Major, we
Americans consider ourselves the greatest nation
on earth; and being Americans, we have to say so.
Perhaps you have noticed that?”</p>

<p>“I have,” assented Floyd, “and I have lived in
America long enough to learn to like hearing you
say so. I like the young American’s passionate
affection for his country and all her institutions,
and his fixed determination to boost everything
connected with her. The other day I was waiting
in a village for an American Staff car which was
being sent for me from Chaumont. I found one
standing at the corner of the street, so I asked the
chauffeur, thinking he might be from headquarters,—‘Where
are you from?’ And he sat up, and replied,
all in one breath, as if I had pressed a button,—‘Sir,
I am from Marion, Ohio, the Greatest
Steam-Shovel Producing Centre in the World!’—Just
like that. That is what I call the right spirit.
But I am interrupting you, Colonel.”</p>

<p>“You British, on the other hand,” resumed the
Colonel, “also consider yourselves the greatest
nation upon earth, but you do not say so to people,
because you take it for granted that they know
already!”</p>

<p>“A palpable hit, sir!” conceded Floyd, amid
laughter.</p>

<p>“Well,” continued the Colonel, “those two
points of view required quite a little adjustment,
in the first place. Then again, there was a certain
amount of ‘We-have-come-to-win-this-War-for
you’ stuff from our boys, and a certain amount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
of ‘You-have-been-a-darned-long-while-making-up
your-minds-about-it’ stuff from yours; and all
these little corners had to be rounded off. On top
of that there was a lot of very insidious, very
clever work by German agencies, to make trouble
between them. But you know about that. Then,
they suffered from the handicap of a common language.
Believe me, it’s a darned sight easier to
keep on clubby terms with an ally whose language
you don’t know than an ally whose language you
do! But they are wise to one another now. Each
has learned to respect and tolerate the other’s point
of view. Of course they don’t <em>understand</em> one
another; and never will. In that respect they are
three thousand miles and several centuries apart.
So they tacitly agreed to regard one another as
crazy, but likeable—and leave it at that. In my
view that is about as far as Anglo-American sentiment
will ever get; and I shall be glad and satisfied
if we here, who <em>know</em>, can maintain it at that
standard—and it’s a higher standard than would
appear at first sight. But I am talking too much.
Where was I?”</p>

<p>“You were going to tell us a story about a tank,
sir,” announced a respectful voice.</p>

<p>“Was I? Well, I might as well, for we can do
nothing at this moment but wait. Up north, in
September, my outfit were attacking day after day,
with an escort of British tanks. The Germans were
scared to death of those tanks. They did everything
to stop them—brought up field guns to
point-blank range; dug deep ditches, sprung land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
mines, and everything. The tanks suffered; but
they never weakened, and most of them arrived at
their objective. Their crews were marvels, and as
for the children who commanded them, they were
the cunningest little things you ever saw. One day
we were detailed to carry a village, lying just back
of a wood. We got there in the course of time, rather
more easily than I had expected. When our men
reached the little market-square, the reason revealed
itself, in the form of a British tank, squatting
plumb in the centre, having beaten us to it
by four minutes. The usual infant was in charge,
sitting on the top and twirling the place where he
hoped one day to raise a mustache. When he saw
our senior Major doubling down the street at the
head of our men, he scrambled down and saluted
very smart and proper, and said: ‘Major, I hereby
hand over this village to you, as my superior officer,
with cordial compliments, world without end,
Amen!’—or words to that effect. The Major saluted
back, very polite, and thanked him. Then the
child said, kind of thoughtfully, jerking his head
towards the grinning Tommies who were peeking
out of the inside of the machine: ‘Still, we wish
somehow, don’t you know, that we had something
to show—just to show, sir, that we were here first.’
The Major thought a minute. Then he said, ‘I can
fix that for you. I’ll give you a receipt for the village.’
And he did!” concluded the Colonel, amid a
rising tide of laughter: “<i>Received from officer commanding
British Tank, ‘Bing Boy,’ one village—in
poor condition.</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>A salvo of German five-point-nine shells detonated
amid the tree-roots far above their heads.</p>

<p>“Enemy getting nervous,” commented the
Colonel. “Let him wait! Our artillery preparation
isn’t due for an hour or more. Now, do you boys
understand your orders? Any questions to ask?
If so, shoot! That’s what I’m here for.”</p>

<p>He answered one or two eleventh-hour inquiries,
and added: “Make the most of this attack. You
may not have another opportunity.”</p>

<p>“You mean,” suggested Floyd, “that this battle
is going to peter out?”</p>

<p>“I mean,” replied Colonel Graham deliberately,
“that this war is going to peter out! And,”
he added, with sudden concentrated bitterness,
“if it does—<em>now</em>—we Americans are going to
regret it for the rest of our history!”</p>

<p>The figures round the table sat up—quite literally.
But one or two of the older men nodded their
heads.</p>

<p>“If only we could be allowed to go on for another
three months!” pursued the Colonel earnestly.
“If only this great beautiful machine of an American
Army could be given a chance to climb to its
top speed! Then we should be functioning in proper
shape—with our own guns, and our own tanks,
plenty of horse-transport, and sufficient airplanes
to direct our own fire and locate the enemy’s. We
should be employing acquired experience instead
of borrowed experience. We should have a trained
Staff. We could send these great-hearted boys of
ours into action adequately protected by a perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
timed barrage. We could cut down our
casualties seventy-five per cent, and make future
victories a real matter for rejoicing. Of course it
won’t matter to the folks at home. They have
no opportunity to discriminate. They would cheer
themselves hoarse over us if we were a Sanitary
Section from the Base. But—we should like to
show our friends over here what the American Army
really is and not merely what it is going to be.
And—we could extract some sort of adequate interest
from the capital—the capital of our men’s
lives—that we have been sinking in this year’s
campaign. But there isn’t time! There isn’t time!”
The old soldier’s gnarled fist dropped despairingly
upon the trestle table. “We are still on our second
speed, and however hard we may step on the gas,
we can’t get real results for a little while to come.
There isn’t time!”</p>

<p>There was a pause, while another salvo burst
overhead. Then Jim Nichols asked:—</p>

<p>“Colonel, just why are you so sure? Is Peace
really on the way?”</p>

<p>(Certainly, the question was worth asking.
Within the past five days the following rumours
have reached us, <i lang="la">seriatim</i>, supported by every
variety of unreliable testimony:—</p>

<p>(1) Austria is trying to quit.</p>

<p>(2) The German Fleet has come out and surrendered.</p>

<p>(3) Kiel is in the hands of mutineers.</p>

<p>(4) The Kaiser and the Crown Prince have
abdicated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>(5) Germany has asked for Peace, and Foch has
given her seventy-two hours to accept his terms.)</p>

<p>“Not peace,” replied the Colonel, “nor anything
like it. But an armistice may come any day. From
all accounts the Hun is willing to submit to almost
any terms so long as he can get out now, while the
going is any good at all. That looks as if his military
discipline were growing shaky—or else his civilian
morale. Perhaps both. Anyway, he seems suspiciously
anxious to quit. The real question is,
What are we going to do about it?”</p>

<p>“I fancy we are going to accede to his request,”
said Floyd. “In all probability, if we hammered
him for another six weeks or so, we should have
him in such a state that only a vacuum-cleaner
could clear up the mess. We should probably take
a million prisoners. We could sit down upon the
Boche’s prostrate carcass and dictate any terms
we pleased. But—but—but—well, there <em>might</em>
be a miscarriage. We might find ourselves committed
to another year’s campaigning. Labour, so-called,
is getting fed up, and, though we are driving
the Huns before us like sheep, an avoidable casualty-list
might produce a crisis in that quarter.
As you say, Colonel, the big American machine is
running more smoothly and powerfully every day;
but France and Britain are down to a pretty fine
edge now.”</p>

<p>“But your men and the French are all veterans,
Major,” exclaimed Jim Nichols: “the finest
material—”</p>

<p>“That is just the trouble,” said Floyd, shaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
his head. “In this crazy war veterans are no use.
To-day experience simply means loss of nerve.
The most effective—the only effective—troops
in this kind of warfare are young, green, ignorant
recruits, and the British and French have precious
few of that type left. They all know too much now!
Moreover, the people at home are suffering badly.
They have not too much to eat, and the casualty-list
is approaching the three-million mark. They
are not kicking: they are prepared to go on for
another twenty years if national security demands
it: but it is the sacrifice of the last few lives in a
war at which national conscience boggles, and I
fancy that if our statesmen see a chance of a victorious
peace they will grab it.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid you are right, Major,” sighed the
Colonel. “Looks as if we were going to weaken on
the proposition of the knock-out blow. If we do,
two things are going to happen. First, hundreds
and thousands of American boys over at home are
going to break their hearts. Think of it! Months
and months of hard training and feverish anticipation
in those big dreary camps. Then—on their
top note of anticipation—Peace! Demobilization!
Reaction! Instead of soldiers—and remember the
title ‘soldier’ is the proudest in the world!—with
a record of duty done and victory achieved, we
shall have created a few million disgruntled,
unemployed, unemployable might-have-beens—robbed,
<em>robbed</em>, of their fair share in the greatest
Adventure that life can offer!”</p>

<p>“Still,” rejoined Floyd, “you can honestly tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
them this: When the credit for the victories of this
summer comes to be apportioned, a big share must
go to troops which have never set foot in France—which
have never even had the chance to leave
America: because it was the promise of their presence
that enabled Foch to take the offensive right
away—to take chances, in fact, which would have
been utterly impossible if he had not known that he
had the whole trained manhood of America behind
him. So their labour was not altogether in vain, you
see!”</p>

<p>But the old war-horse refused to be comforted.</p>

<p>“We <em>ought</em> to go on, Major,” he said doggedly.
“That brings me to the other thing I said was
going to happen. America, as a whole, has not yet
felt this War: and she <em>must</em>, if she is to extract from
it the benefit that belongs to her by right. What
are a quarter of a million casualties to a nation the
size of ours? We <em>ought</em> to suffer some more, if only
to save us from unreadiness and mismanagement
in the future. If we stop now, all that we shall have
won will be the opportunity—and you know how
our orators and patriotism-mongers will use it—to
announce that America just stepped in, and the
War was won! It may be true; it may not; but that
line of talk never did any good to any nation. We
here round this table all know that, and there are
thousands of folk at home who know it too. Yes, we
ought to get deeper in. God knows, no one wants
to make widows and orphans. But a war, however
bloody, which teaches a nation its own weaknesses,
is worth while. Individuals suffer, as individuals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
must and do; but the commonwealth gains. It is
true we are losing good Americans by the hundred
to-day; but we are making thousands more. Listen.
A few weeks ago I was in a Field Dressing-Station,
talking to the wounded. One man replied to my
enquiries in a strong foreign accent. He was a
splendid-looking boy—a Dane, I guess. I asked
him: ‘What nationality are you?’ He looked just
the least bit surprised, and replied: ‘American,
sure!’ I said: ‘I can see that, son: but tell me, what
<em>made</em> you an American?’ And he laid his hand on
a great whale of a wound in his side, and he said,
quite simply: ‘<em>That</em> made me an American!’ And
that is what this War is doing for our big, beloved,
half-grown country—making Americans! And
now we’ve got to quit!”</p>

<p>“Still,” smiled Floyd, “you have made a good
many. You have a couple of million of them over
here now, and they will form a very useful leaven
when they get home again. He is a great man, your
Doughboy, Colonel. I have been privileged to make
his acquaintance, and I have seen him fight: and I
take off my tin hat to him, because I know what his
difficulties have been. When he gets home he will
no doubt be smothered in praise—by people incapable
of discriminating between the easy and the
difficult things that he did. But he will deserve all
that he gets, and more, on account of the difficulties
he overcame which people at home know nothing
about—the things that never get into the papers.”</p>

<p>There was a sympathetic murmur from the company.
The Colonel nodded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are right, Major,” he said cheerfully.
“Meanwhile, I wish to report that I feel much
better. I needed that outburst badly. Moreover,
I don’t say that I have any particular <em>personal</em>
objection to a spell of Peace. I guess we can all do
with a vacation. How will you celebrate your first
day, Major?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Floyd thoughtfully.
“The idea of Peace does not particularly appeal to
me in my present frame of mind. More than three
quarters of a million of my fellow-countrymen
have been killed during the past four years—most
of them in their early twenties—and at my
time of life I feel almost ashamed to be alive. And
the idea of ‘settling down’ does not altogether
attract me, either. As you very rightly observe,
Colonel, the community may benefit by a good
searching war, but, by God! individuals suffer.
Especially if they happen to be of that misguided
type which hastens to get into the scrap first, while
wiser persons are deciding whether to volunteer or
be fetched. That was when I lost my friends—in
nineteen-fourteen and fifteen. That stratum of our
community has almost ceased to exist. My own
Battalion has been replaced—which means wiped
out—thirteen times in four years, and I, even I,
only am left. So I view the prospect of settling
down with mixed feelings. Tell us how <em>you</em> propose
to spend the first day of the Armistice, Colonel—when
it comes!”</p>

<p>“I?” said the Colonel. “I shall start by sending
a cable to the best little woman in America, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
little town in Tennessee that you never heard of,
Major; telling her that I have come through, and
that she and the bunch of marauders that belong
to both of us—we have two boys and two girls—can
quit worrying. Then I shall sit down and amplify
my sentiments in a letter. But I am old and
sentimental. What will you do, Jim Nichols?”</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll muster the Battalion,” replied the
newly promoted and zealous second in command,
“and have them clean up their rifles and equipment.
They’re in a terrible mess, after the time
we’ve been having.”</p>

<p>“Well, well! We’ll try some one less wedded to
his duty!” laughed the Colonel. “What will you
do, boy?” He turned to the youthful aviator.</p>

<p>Master Harvey Blane meditated. He had twice
been wounded, once brought down in flames, and
several times driven down out of control.</p>

<p>“I guess,” he said at last, “I shall go along down
to the airdrome, and order out my machine, and
have the boys tune her up very carefully. Then I
shall have her wheeled out, and I shall climb on
board and test all the contacts. Then I shall run the
engine for a spell, and maybe take a turn around
the airdrome, along the ground. Then I shall load
up with bombs. Then I shall look up in the sky,
and say: ‘Boys, I don’t think after all I feel like
going out to-day. Run her back and put her to
bed!’”</p>

<p>There was appreciative laughter at this, and
Floyd said:</p>

<p>“That reminds me of an English subaltern of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
acquaintance who came home for a week’s leave
after four continuous months in the Salient, in
nineteen-fifteen—and after that experience one
required a little leave! He took a room at the Savoy
and left certain explicit instructions with the night
clerk about the time he was to be called. In due
course, at three o’clock in the morning, the telephone
beside his bed rang, and our friend sat up
and answered it. The voice of the clerk said:
‘Colonel’s compliments, sir, and he wants you in
the firing-trench immediately.’ And the child
replied: ‘Give <em>my</em> compliments to the Colonel, and
request him to go to Hell!’ Then he rolled over and
slept till the afternoon. His real leave had begun!
He was an artist like yourself, Blane!”</p>

<p>As Floyd concluded this highly probable anecdote,
in his usual sepulchral tone, a signal orderly
came down the steps that led to the regions above,
and handed a despatch to the Adjutant.</p>

<p>Colonel Graham glanced affectionately around
the table.</p>

<p>“I hope you boys will all be in a position soon to
send me such a message!” he said. “But only for a
week or two, mind! Leave, not Demobilization.
We haven’t finished the War yet.”</p>

<p>The Adjutant handed him the despatch. Colonel
Graham adjusted his glasses, read it, and looked
up.</p>

<p>“Yes, we have,” he said. “The rumours were
true. German delegates are to meet Allied delegates
at five o’clock this morning, when the Allied
terms will be dictated. <em>Dictated</em>, not discussed!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
He glanced at his wrist-watch. “They are being
dictated at this moment. Boys, we are through!
For better or worse, we are through with this War!
Countermand the attack.”</p>

<p>Lastly, two friends of ours in Paris.</p>

<p>This is an unsatisfactory world, and our destinies
are not always controlled as we could wish. But
occasionally—just once or twice, maybe, in a
lifetime—something happens (or is arranged for
us) which so utterly transcends our own dreams
and deserts as to restore our faith in an All-Wise
and All-Benevolent Providence once and for all.</p>

<p>Frances Lane had been transferred to a military
hospital in Paris. Here she discharged, cheerfully
and efficiently, those minor and unheroic duties
which the professional healer is accustomed to
depute to the amateur.</p>

<p>One morning, during the last week in October,
she was called upon in the ordinary course of business
to sit by the bedside of a young officer who had
just been wheeled from the operating-room, until
such time as he should “come out of the ether.”
And the young officer was Boone Cruttenden.
Hence the foregoing appreciative reference to the
workings of Providence.</p>

<p>Boone duly emerged from one form of oblivion
to enter upon another, hardly less complete. In
the first, he had been oblivious to everything. In
the second, he was oblivious to everything and
everybody save Frances. The malady proved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
catching, and both patients imagined, as usual,
that their symptoms were undetected by the outside
world. So the War had to take care of itself
for a while.</p>

<p class="tb">At the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the
eleventh month of the year nineteen-eighteen
these twain found themselves wandering side by
side—with Frances on the right, ferociously interposing
her slim person between Boone’s strapped
and bandaged arm and the rest of humanity—through
the congested Boulevards; waiting, waiting,
like every one else, for Something Official to
be announced.</p>

<p>During the previous day <i lang="fr">tout Paris</i>, in Sabbath
attire, had roamed restlessly, silently, expectantly,
about the streets. Night had fallen, and the throng
had not abated. The great city was as murky as
ever. Peace might be hovering in the air, but War
precautions still prevailed on earth. Small, ghostly,
electric lights, encased in dark-blue glass, still
indicated rather than illuminated the wayfarer’s
path. At intervals a discreet, faintly luminous sign,
bearing the legend <i lang="fr">Abri</i>, proffered a refuge from
the terror that flies by night. Through this gross
darkness, silently, furtively, the great concourse
drifted and groped. Only over La Place de la Concorde,
like the promise of victorious Dawn, the sky
was bright with the lights newly unveiled to illuminate
the great array of trophies—German guns,
German aeroplanes, festoons of German helmets—set
up for the advancement of the latest War<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Loan—“The Loan of the Last Quarter of an Hour,” as
the posters happily described it.</p>

<p>On Monday morning the crowd was still there.
It had contrived to slip home and put on its working-clothes,
but that was all. The shops were open,
but no one appeared to be buying anything. There
was little sound. Occasionally the most unlikely-looking
persons were accosted and asked, “<i lang="fr">On a
signé?</i>” But it did not matter, as no one ever stayed
for an answer. Paris was waiting.</p>

<p>Then in a moment, about the stroke of eleven,
the electric discharge came. Cries arose from various
parts of the city. The newspaper offices and information
bureaux broke into simultaneous, preconcerted
animation.</p>

<p>In the Boulevard des Italiens, Boone and Frances,
standing amid a vast throng facing the office of
<cite lang="fr">Le Matin</cite>, suddenly became aware, between two
intervals of whispered confidences, that the huge
map of the Western Front which covered the outer
wall of the building, upon whose surface, through
months of alternate agony and triumph, the ebb
and flow of battle had been recorded by an undulating
array of tiny flags, was being obliterated by
a series of great printed slips, set one above another.
The first of these had already been put in
position. It said:</p>

<p class="center">L’ARMISTICE EST SIGNÉE!</p>

<p>There came a buzz of excitement from the
crowd, but little noise. The second slip was going
up:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>“<em>A-a-a-ah!</em>” Here was a new thought. “We have
won—<em>won!</em> We have beaten him—beaten the
Boche! <i lang="fr">Enfin!</i>” Men and women began to grip one
another’s hands. The confused, uncertain buzzing
rose higher, and the third slip went up:—</p>

<p class="center">VIVE LA FRANCE!</p>

<p>That settled it. Next moment every hat was in
the air. <em>This</em> was what everybody had been waiting
for. Every French man, woman, and child was
shouting, or crying, or embracing his neighbour.
France! France! France—safe, free, victorious!
France!</p>

<p>The last strip was unrolled:—</p>

<p class="center">VIVENT LES ALLIÉS!</p>

<p>This time it was a different demonstration.
Mingled with it were the enthusiastic cheers of
the Parisian—the glowing, grateful tribute of the
principal sufferer to the friends from all over the
globe who had stood by her so stoutly. But in the
main it was a deep, full-throated, Anglo-Saxon
roar. In that crowd stood scores of British and
hundreds of American soldiers. Higher and higher
rose the cheering. They were not blind cheers.
They were cheers of realization. A job of work well
and truly completed! No more trenches! No more
mud! No more Hell! No more death! Victory!
Peace! Home! Sweethearts and Wives!</p>

<p>It was at this point, for the first time, that
Boone Cruttenden kissed Frances Lane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>Thereafter, a brief period of uncertainty; then
Paris settled down to rejoice in earnest.</p>

<p>It is not easy to rejoice suddenly—after four
and a half years of stoical endurance. Still, by
noon, Paris had settled down into her stride. The
<i lang="fr">midinettes</i> and <i lang="fr">ouvrières</i> had come out for their
dinner-hour, and none manifested any intention of
returning to their labours. In the balconies outside
the great millinery shops of the Rue de la Paix
lovely creatures in kimonos, of the <i lang="fr">mannequin</i>
tribe, forgetful of the whole duty of a <i lang="fr">mannequin</i>,
which is to languish and glide, were hanging far
out over the seething street, waving, weeping, and
screaming like common persons.</p>

<p>The city had broken out into flags. Every window
sported one. Every person carried one. None
of your miniature, buttonhole affairs; but a good,
flapping tricolour, or Union Jack, or Stars and
Stripes, three feet square, carried over the shoulder
on a pole six feet long.</p>

<p>Every one felt it incumbent upon him to show
some slight civility to his neighbour. Soldiers
saluted civilians; civilians embraced soldiers.
Young military gentlemen kissed young ladies of
the dressmaking persuasion. Exuberant daughters
of Gaul joined hands and danced in a ring round
embarrassed Anglo-Saxon officers, or tweaked the
tails of the Glengarry bonnets of passing “Jocks.”
At each <i lang="fr">porte-cochère</i> snuffy concierges were phlegmatically
tearing down the printed signs tacked
upon the outer doors—<i lang="fr">Abri, 25 places</i>—with an
almost genial, “<i lang="fr">Et voilà!</i>” A spirit of brotherly love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
prevailed: Boone and Frances saw a Paris taxi-driver
distinctly slow down to avoid running over
two young ladies whose cavaliers were playfully
endeavouring to push them under his front wheels.</p>

<p>Presently an aged man in a blue blouse and a
species of yachting-cap accosted them.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Américain?</i>” he demanded.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Oui</i>,” admitted Boone cautiously. He had
already stalled off more than one would-be kisser.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Blessé!</i>” added Frances proudly.</p>

<p>The old gentleman shook hands with both of
them, several times. Tears were running down his
cheeks.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Et maintenant</i>,” he told them, “<i lang="fr">mon fils
reviendra!</i>”</p>

<p>And he hobbled off, to spread the great news
elsewhere.</p>

<p class="tb">By the afternoon Paris had resolved itself into
processions, mainly of soldiers and girls intertwined.
Nearly everybody was singing. The French sang
the <cite lang="fr">Marseillaise</cite>, or <cite lang="fr">Madelon</cite>. The English-speaking
races devoted their energy, which was considerable,
to a ditty with the mysterious refrain—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i>Would you rather be a Colonel, with an eagle on your shoulder,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Or a private, with a chicken on your knee?</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Ordinary vehicular traffic had almost entirely
removed itself from the streets—probably from
the instinct of self-preservation; for the few taxis
which still survived carried never less than fifteen
passengers, mostly on the roof. But huge military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
motor-trucks were ubiquitous. They were mainly
British and American, but they bore a cargo completely
representative of the Franco-Italo-Anglo-American
<i lang="fr">entente</i>, from the impromptu jazz-band of
some thirty artistes perched upon the canvas roof,
to the quartette of Australian soldiers and their
lady friends sitting astride the radiator, bob-sleigh
fashion, and wearing one another’s hats. It is needless
to add that small French boys adhered like
flies to all the less accessible parts of the vehicle.</p>

<p>As evening approached, and the electric arc-lamps
awoke sizzling and sputtering from their
enforced sleep of many gloomy months, one question
began to exercise the collective faculties of the
celebrants:—</p>

<p>“Where shall we go to-night?”</p>

<p>In most cases the answer was simple enough. At
moments of intense mental exaltation the Anglo-Saxon
in Paris turns to the Folies Bergères as
simply and spontaneously as your true Moslem
turns towards Mecca at the call of the muezzin.
But Boone and Frances cared for none of these
things.</p>

<p>“Listen, dear,” said Boone. “Let’s go to some
place that’s <em>quiet</em>, where we can get by ourselves!”</p>

<p>“That will be too lovely,” agreed the other
optimist, as she struggled panting through the
press. “But <em>where</em>, darling?”</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, some place where we won’t meet
any one we know,” said Boone, with the first instinct
of the newly affianced; and Frances concurred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>After dinner, at a restaurant whose proprietor
had exuberantly decided to celebrate the cessation
of hostilities by trebling prices all round—a dinner
at which purely private and domestic plans were
raptly discussed amid an atmosphere of riotous
publicity—they went to a <i lang="fr">revue</i>.</p>

<p>It was not the usual French war-time <i lang="fr">revue</i>
for Anglo-Saxon consumption—with syncopated
melodies and Cockney chorus-girls, imperfectly
disguised as Parisiennes. It was a <i lang="fr">revue intime</i>,
intended for Paris alone, and was full of delicate
fancies, and esoteric jokes, and mysterious topical
allusions. Boone and Frances understood possibly
one third of the dialogue and one in a hundred of
the allusions. But they enjoyed the <i lang="fr">revue</i> exceedingly.
In their present frame of mind they would
have enjoyed a Greenwich Village mystery-play,
or <cite>Hamlet</cite> without cuts.</p>

<p>The audience was almost exclusively Parisian—officers
in uniform; fair women wearing their jewels
for the first time in months; stout, bald, bearded
citizens of the bourgeoisie; here and there a British
uniform. But so far as our own particular pair of
truants could see, they were the only Americans
present.</p>

<p>From the boulevard outside came the muffled
tramp of feet; shouts of triumph; coy feminine
shrieks; the honking of motor-horns; the clink of
cow-bells—all suggestive of New Year’s Eve on
Broadway. But inside the theatre the <i lang="fr">revue</i> flowed
smoothly on. No one on the stage made any allusion
to the matter which was bursting all hearts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Not that there was no tension, both on the stage
and in the auditorium. In theatre-land it is an understood
thing that upon occasions of public rejoicing
the actors and the play take second place,
while the audience, for one night only, steps into
the spot-light and plays “lead.” For instance, at
this moment, not many blocks away, upon the
stage of the Folies Bergères a self-appointed band
of khaki-clad enthusiasts were assisting a hysterical
<i lang="fr">corps de ballet</i> in the execution of its duty.</p>

<p>But the <i lang="fr">revue intime</i> pursued its intimate course.
The piece was too delicately planned and executed
to admit of unauthorized “gags” or inartistic interpolations.
The audience, being Parisian, realized
this, and waited. A time would come. Meanwhile,
they leaned back in their seats, fanned themselves,
and laughed at the jokes. But the fans moved very
rapidly, and the laughs sounded rather breathless—rather
like sobs.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, unexpectedly, at the end of the
second act, came the cracking-point.</p>

<p>The scene was laid in a restaurant. (Not that
that mattered; a sewing-circle would have served
equally well.) The glittering little company were
already gathered upon the stage for the <i lang="fr">finale</i>.
They were headed by the leading lady—young,
blonde, lovely; a shimmering vision in silver—prepared
to burst into song. The orchestra gave
her a preliminary chord; she opened her carmine
lips. And then, to her entered from the wings,
apparently without cue or authorization, the principal
comedian, in the rôle of the head waiter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the restaurant—preposterous weeping whiskers
and all.</p>

<p>He walked to the footlights, turned to the audience,
and announced, quite simply:—</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">L’Armistice est signée!</i>”</p>

<p>The thing came with such consummate unexpectedness—the
thing they had been expecting
all evening—that for a moment no one stirred.
Then, with a rush, the audience were on their feet;
so were the orchestra. One long-drawn, triumphant
electrifying chord sprang—apparently of its own
volition—from their instruments, and a tremor
ran through the theatre. The girl in silver stepped
forward, and broke into the <cite lang="fr">Marseillaise</cite>, with tears
raining down her face.…</p>

<p>“Name of a name of a name!” An old French
colonel, standing beside Boone, was muttering
brokenly to himself. Boone could see his fingernails
whiten as he grasped the back of the seat in
front of him. Boone contented himself with Frances’s
hand, and together they gazed up at the
singer. There she stood—slender, radiant, beautiful,
with not too much on, shedding abundant,
genuine tears over an artificial complexion. She
<i lang="fr">was</i> Paris—Paris personified—Paris unclothed
and in her right mind—Paris come to her own
again.</p>

<p>The curtain fell—rose—fell—rose—while
the storm of cheers raged. About the tenth time it
rose again, to stay. The girl had both her hands
pressed to her face, and her body was shaking.
But another chord from the orchestra—the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
chord—steadied her. She dropped her hands by
her sides, uplifted her limpid voice, and sang the
<cite lang="fr">Marseillaise</cite> once more.</p>

<p>But this time her <i lang="fr">entourage</i> had increased. Upon
the outskirts of the stage—sidling in from the
wings, peeping round the proscenium, mingling
bodily with the glittering, shimmering company—there
appeared another throng. Scene-shifters;
dressers; lusty firemen; brown-faced <i lang="fr">poilus</i>; gendarmes;
mysterious individuals in decayed dress-suits;
little boys and girls, indicative of the fact
that even <i lang="fr">revue</i> artists contract domestic ties—they
all edged on, and sang the <cite lang="fr">Marseillaise</cite> too.
If the girl in the centre was Paris, this shining,
grimy, patient, cheerful, wistful, triumphant throng
around her was France. France—with the black
shadow of forty years rolled away from her horizon!
France—the much-enduring, the all-surviving, the
indomitable; with her beloved capital inviolate
still, and her lost provinces coming back to her!
<i lang="la">Gallia Victrix.</i> No wonder they sang. <i lang="fr">La Guerre
est gagnée</i>—at last!</p>

<p>There let us leave them all—on the crest of
the wave. <i lang="fr">La Guerre est gagnée.</i> God send that we
tackle <i lang="fr">La Paix</i> as successfully!</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
